Hi Tiffini,

I have many questions! I understand you may not have answers for all of these,
I'm happy to help find or suggest answers and create a detailed statement of
work and estimate.

Regarding design/look and feel:
* Do you already have a design for the websites?
* Is there a designer you've already chosen to work with?
* Would you want me (or someone I'm working with) to create designs?

* How do you want these websites to be updated?
  - Should these have their own simple databases, independent from other UPCI
    systems or,
  - Is there an existing system of record for this information?
  - If there is already a system of record for this information, do adequate
    means for updating this data already exist or do we need to build
    something to make it easier for staff to update these lists?
  - If there is not already a system of record we need to talk about how users
    can update the database we will build to power this.

* More generally, how would you like to be administering
* It looks like the existing OOF website uses AWS S3 for image hosting

## Timeline

* Bid timeline?
* Project timeline?

## Design

* Already have designs?
* Already have a designer?
* Looking to me to create designs?
  - Inspiration, guide for intended look?

    Originally started out mimicing the UPCI website (black and gold) but
    that's currently being overhauled. Probably more going to be white, blues,
    greens, etc.

* Target platforms?
  - Kiosk?
  - Desktop?
  - Wall display?
  - Mobile?
  - Reports/Export?

    Primarily the three large wall screens, tablet/mobile for Guidroz. 
    No discussion re. modbile form-factor.

## User Interaction

* How are users expected to interact with this system?
  - Walk up and touch the wall.
  - OOF touch the year or search for a name.

* How do we want administrators to be able to update the system?
  - 

## Data

* Is this a standalone system or does it integrate with other UPCI data
  systems?
  - What is the system of record for this information?
  - How do we authenticate admin users? Are we creating a dedicated
    username/password for this application or are we tieing into an existing
    SSO solution?

* Where should this live?
  - Hosting: It looks like there is already an existing AWS account that is
    serving the content for the current OOF. Does the UPCI own this?
  - Domain: still using oof

## Budget

*

Ron Guidroz vision for wall listing all deceased ministers. He wanted an actual
physical wall but that's not really feasible. Now thinking about a wall with
three screens with different info. Also wants a mobile version available that
he can bring with him to GC booth.

* Wall done by GC. TC wants Aug. 1st. Starting construction next month, wall
  ready by May or June. 

Challenges accessing "our" stuff.


* Wall of Honor - Deceased Ministers
* Wall of Honor - Order of the Faith
* Wall of Honor - Current Leadership
