        "biography": "<p>Stanley W. Chambers was born July 20, 1915, in Columbus, Ohio. He was born again of the water and the Spirit at the church pastored by W. T. Witherspoon. It was in New York, while working in the church pastored by Andrew Urshan, that he received his call into the ministry. It was also in New York that he met his life’s companion, Catherine Strepka. Four children came from this union: Jean Catherine (Cowell), Judith Mae (Bentley), the late Lawrence Stanley, and Jerolyn Marie (Kelley).</p><p>Stanley Chambers began his full time ministry pastoring the church in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. In addition to this responsibility, he conducted a radio program and started a new congregation in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. He was also chosen to serve as the secretary of the eastern district of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ, to which he belonged.</p><p>In 1945, he and wife Catherine traveled to St. Louis to attend the conference in which the United Pentecostal Church was formed by the merging of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated (PCI) and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ (PAJC). In this merger, it was decided that Brother Howard Goss of the PCI would be the superintendent of the new organization and Brother Witherspoon would be the assistant superintendent.</p><p>A secretary was needed for the new organization. Stanley Chambers was thirty years old at the time and had only held ministerial license for three years. It was required in the organizations by-laws that a man must hold ministerial credentials for five years before he could fill this office. The brethren voted to waive this ruling, and thus Stanley Chambers became the youngest man to ever hold high office in the United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>Brother Chambers served efficiently and faithfully in this position for twenty-two years, under the leadership of Howard Goss and Arthur Morgan. Brother Morgan died as he was addressing a board meeting at the 1967 General Conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Brother Chambers was elected to serve as the new general superintendent.</p><p>Under Brother Chambers’s leadership, a new headquarters was built and paid for in Hazelwood, Missouri. For the first time the UPC published its own Sunday school curriculum entitled Word Aflame. He served in this position until he chose to step down in 1977.</p><p>He was chosen to serve as district superintendent of his home state of Missouri in 1983. He served for ten years and then chose to step down from his position as state superintendent.</p><p>Brother Chambers continued preaching worldwide during the years that followed. One highlight of those years was the opportunity to serve as pastor of the church in Vienna, Austria, for an extended period of time. He continued to serve on committees and boards connected with the official work of the United Pentecostal Church. He was a long time member of the board of Tupelo Children’s Mansion.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Born September 21, 1928, in Jackson, Tennessee, Cleveland M. Becton was the second son of James M. and Christine M. Becton. At the age of two, his family moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where his mother’s brother, Reverend G. H. Brown, pastored a Pentecostal church. The family did not immediately attend the church that he pastored; however, after attending the First Baptist Church for a short period of time, his parents felt that they should make a change. This was the beginning of their experience of Pentecost, both parents receiving the Pentecostal experience.</p><p>In the summer of 1940, in a revival meeting with Brother Odell Cagle, Cleveland Becton received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and was baptized in the name of Jesus. At the age of fifteen, he left home with his parent’s consent and, properly chaperoned, played for the Stamps Quartette. At the age of sixteen, he was teaching piano and accordion in the Stamps School of Music in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>Pentecostal Bible Institute was opening for their first year in Tupelo, Mississippi. In the fall of 1945, along with approximately twenty-eight others, he became a pioneer student for the very first term. It was in the second semester of that year, while in a weekend service in Iuka, Mississippi, he felt the call into the ministry. He was seventeen years of age and started in the evangelistic work when that term ended. His first revival experience was in Nashville, Tennessee. His evangelistic days continued until the fall of 1950 when he took his first church to pastor in Bay City, Texas.</p><p>While growing up in the church in Little Rock, Arkansas, Brother Becton met a family by the name of Dyson, also members of that church. They had several children, and one of them, a daughter named Margie, was about the same age as Cleveland. They were married in 1947. Right away she became an evangelist’s wife and three years later a pastor’s wife.</p><p>They had three wonderful children. Rudy was born in 1948 and traveled with them from the time that he was three weeks old until they settled down to pastor when he was two years of age. Ronald was born in 1952, in Bay City, Texas, where they continued pastoring until 1957. In 1957, they became the first pastor of  a small group of people in North Little Rock, Arkansas, and it was there they had their third child, a daughter, Renee, who made their family complete. They moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1960 to become the pastor of the West Nashville Pentecostal Church. The name was later changed to the First United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>Their three children are all married.  Rudy married Helen McNalley and they have two children, Alicia and Arlen.  Ronald married Cheryl Grisham and they have one son, Austin. Renee married Richard Flowers and they have two sons, Chad and Chase. All of them have been baptized in the name of Jesus and are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. All of them, including the grandchildren, are working for the Lord.</p><p>Following are the positions Brother Becton held in the United Pentecostal Church:</p><p>1952-1957 Youth Secretary of the Texas District</p><p>1958-1960 Home Missions Director of the Arkansas District</p><p>1961-1967 Secretary of the International Youth Division</p><p>1968-1976 General Secretary of the UPCI</p><p>1978-1981 Assistant General Superintendent of the UPCI</p><p>1982-1998 General Secretary of the UPCI</p><p>1982- One of two speakers on Harvestime</p><p>1999- Honorary UPCI General Board member</p><p>In the 1998 General Conference, held in Greensboro, North Carolina, Brother Becton felt he should not let his name stand any longer for the position of General Secretary. Brother Jerry Jones was elected at that conference to succeed him. A total of twenty-five years as General Secretary came to an end December 31, 1998. The Bectons moved to Texas and attended Emmanuel Pentecostal Church pastored by their son-in-law, Richard Flowers. They did not retire, but continued to travel for some time.</p><p>Brother Becton passed from this life November 16, 2010.</p>",

At twelve years of age, he moved with his family to a farm in Lynn, Indiana, where he later assisted his father in starting a Pentecostal church, and preached his first sermon at fifteen years of age. At age sixteen, he helped pioneer and pastor a church in Greenville, Ohio. He served as the vice president for the Indiana/Michigan District Pentecostal Young Peoples Association (PYPA) in the early 1940s, prior to the merger forming the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI).</p><p>While attending Apostolic Bible Institute in St. Paul, Minnesota, he pastored two congregations: Baronett and Spooner, Wisconsin. He married an ABI student, Marjorie Guinn of St. Louis, in 1944. They moved to Richmond, Indiana, where Robert began pastoring a small congregation. Here they were blessed with three children: Robert Lee, Lois Marie, and Edward Ray. New property was purchased, and with the help of his father, Robert, and the congregation he constructed a new church building and experienced steady growth during the next thirteen years. Brother McFarland resigned the pastorate in 1957 to become a full-time missionary to the Middle Eastern Arab nations.</p><p>In 1961, due to unrest in Jerusalem, he returned to the states and was unanimously elected as pastor when his father resigned in Marion, Indiana. Under his capable leadership, the congregation built and dedicated a new church facility, debt free. As the first Indiana District Bible quiz master, he established a strong Bible quizzing state.</p><p>In 1975, Brother McFarland was elected to serve full time as Indiana district superintendent, and moved to the Indiana parsonage on the campground. In addition to pastoring, he gave over half his life in faithful service to Indiana, by serving as youth secretary (1944-1953), district secretary (1953-1957; 1969-1970), Foreign Missions representative (1957-1961; 1967-1969), Home Missions director (1962-1967), and district superintendent (1970-1976). He was also an honorary member of both the Indiana District Board and the General Board (1990-2002).</p><p>In 1976, he was elected to serve as the general secretary of the United Pentecostal Church, in St. Louis, Missouri. His stewardship skills once again were rewarded by the mortgage on the World Evangelism Center being paid off seven years ahead of schedule. In 1981 he resigned as general secretary to become the regional director for Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>He returned to Indiana in 1991, and continued ministering anywhere God led. Pastor Dennis Croucher of Marion, Indiana, installed Brother McFarland as pastor emeritus of the First Pentecostal Church. Brother and Sister McFarland traveled several months presenting the cause of Mothers Memorial. He was involved in the formation of the Veterans of Foreign Missions for the UPCI and served as their first secretary.</p>",

He attended the university for two and one-half years, desiring to be a surgeon.</p><p>After being stricken with tuberculosis and then being miraculously healed, Brother Urshan realized that God had called him to preach and not to fulfill his own ambition to become a surgeon.

        "biography": "<p>On July 12, 1913, Lonzo and Margaret Barnes became the parents of Tom Willis Barnes. When Tom was two years old, his mother placed several toys and a Bible on a pallet in front of him. He reached for the Bible. His mother felt this was a sign her son would be used of God in a special way. A few years later, he told his mother that when he became twelve years old, something special would happen to him. Pentecost came to their little community when he was twelve years old; he and his mother were filled with the Holy Ghost and baptized in Jesus' name. Thus began a life of anointing on this man of faith.</p><p>At the age of twenty-four, he began preaching this Pentecostal message. Before he began preaching on his own, he was helping in a revival when a beautiful young lady, Lucille Farrington, came to the altar and received the Holy Ghost. On September 24, 1937, she became his wife. They have one child, Ruth, four grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.</p><p>After evangelizing a while, Brother Barnes accepted the pastorate of a church in Pinegrove, Arkansas. In 1942 he pastored in the Shiloh community, and in 1943 he went to Pendall, Arkansas, and pastored there for four years. He preached in fourteen different communities in the Ozark hills. On Sunday he would preach three times in different churches and communities.</p><p>As he prayed one day, he was surprised when God told him he would be leaving Pendall in the near future. On September 8, 1947, he and his dear wife and daughter drove into Minden, Louisiana, to become pastor of the small congregation there. Not content to preach to just this small congregation, he began going out into the surrounding communities and holding services in people’s homes, in brush arbors in cotton fields, and in tents wherever he could find a place to put one, and in store front buildings. Many people received the Holy Ghost, and soon the small church in Minden could not hold the people. One of these revivals resulted in his building a church in Gibsland, Louisiana. For two years he pastored both churches, then felt led to call a permanent pastor for the Gibsland church. The Minden First United Pentecostal Church was blessed to have this man of God for their pastor for fifty-six years.</p><p>For nineteen years Brother Barnes served as Home Missions director for the Louisiana District. He touched the lives of thousands of young men and women during his thirty-six years as principal of the Louisiana District youth camps.</p><p>He is the author of three books: Living in the Overflow, Spiritual Warfare, and If You Need Healing.</p><p>Brother Barnes is revered as a man of God in his community. Lawyers, judges, and law enforcement officers have relied on his advice and counsel for many years. In 1998 the Minden Chamber of Commerce named him Man of the Year.</p><p>He has preached many camp meetings and conferences. One highlight of his ministry was preaching in Jerusalem at the UPCI World Conference in 1976. His heartbeat for many years has been to pray for the Jews.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>William Cooling was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on June 17, 1920. Weighing just over three pounds, he had no bone covering the back of his skull. For two weeks an aunt tended and prayed for him. One night as she repeated, “Victory! Victory!” she felt the bone in the back of his head grow, hence his middle name, Victor.</p><p>His parents, Thomas and Rose Cooling, were recent Pentecostal converts. Rose was baptized in Jesus' name just two weeks before Billie was born. Their life, as he grew up, revolved around revival services and prayer meetings. Even though Bill did not live for God during the five years he served in World War II, he went to church every time he had the opportunity.</p><p>On June 30, 1946, Bill, now almost an alcoholic, walked into the back of Bethel Tabernacle in Winnipeg. As the church sang, “Only Jesus, only Jesus, only He can satisfy,” he stumbled down the aisle, fell between the pews, and surrendered his life to God. Six months later, on New Year's Eve, he married a beautiful young lady, Georgina Fuller.</p><p>After Brother Cooling felt the call to the ministry, he worked with his pastors, Brother Vouga and Brother Ralph Reynolds. Then, he stepped out with his family to pastor in Kenora, Ontario, Canada. Except for nine months in British Columbia, the rest of his ministry was in the Ontario district, pastoring in Pembroke, Brantford, St. Catharines, and Brockville. He was a true shepherd and believed and preached truth with an unwavering passion. Camp meeting was the highlight of his life, especially the morning Bible studies when he would lead the congregation in the old songs of the church, singing verse after verse by heart. His favorite was “My Savior’s Love.”</p><p>Brother Cooling served the Ontario District as secretary and Home Missions director simultaneously for twelve years. During that time, the number of churches grew from twelve to thirty-two. He became district superintendent in 1973, and served until his death in 1992. For several years he served as president of the Apostolic Missionary Institute. He was the executive presbyter for Canada from 1990 to 1992.</p><p>He preached a message, “The Prayer of Jabez,” at the 1979 General Conference in Salt Lake City. For many years, he felt honored to sing Canada’s national anthem, O Canada, during the opening ceremony of General Conference.</p><p>His giving nature was his trademark. Every home missionary remembers his coming with his trunk full of groceries, including lots of treats for the children. He loved the Jamaican people, and they loved him.</p><p>The last service he attended, he was so weak that he sat in the second row, resting his head on the pew in front of him. Yet, when the altar call was given, he was the first one there, crawling on his hands and knees.</p><p>On June 10, 1992, he died of an enlarged heart. No one was surprised.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>James G. Lumpkin Sr. was born on October 26, 1929, in Columbus, Georgia. His mother trained him up in the way he should go and prayed earnestly that he would find a special partner in life, one who would share in his good and his quest for life’s best. He met that partner as a young soldier, and on August 13, 1949, James G. Lumpkin Sr. married Jean Rosebraugh.</p><p>Although the Lumpkin-Rosebraugh union was a major milestone in the life of the Lumpkin family, the most important event occurred in the spring of 1951, in Sherman, Texas. The union was eternally sanctified as the Spirit of the Lord entered the lives of the young couple.</p><p>Brother Lumpkin immediately felt there was a special call from the Lord on his life. In 1956 James and Jean moved with their family, which now included Jim Jr. and Mickey to St. Paul, Minnesota, for him to attend Apostolic Bible Institute (ABI). He graduated from there in 1959, and became a member of the school faculty for one year. In 1960 he assumed the pastorate of his first church in Knoxville, Iowa. While he was pastoring there, the second Lumpkin daughter, Tanya, was born.</p><p>James Lumpkin returned to his alma mater to serve on the faculty of ABI from 1964 to 1965. The following year in St. Louis, Missouri, he became promotional director of the Harvestime radio broadcast, a position he held for one year. He then became director of the Harvestime radio broadcast, a position he held for four years. In 1969 he began pastoring in Fort Smith, Arkansas, a role he filled until 1984. In 1974 he was elected the district superintendent of the Arkansas District and was an exemplary leader of that state until 1996. He was founder of Northside Christian Academy in Fort Smith in 1978, and received the national Accelerated Christian Education Sword of the Spirit award in 1979.</p><p>Brother Lumpkin was an honorary member of the UPCI General Board, pastor emeritus of Northside United Pentecostal Church in Fort Smith, chairman of the Board of Directors of Tupelo Children’s Mansion, and vice president of Apostolic Bible Institute. He served as a member of the UPCI Executive Board, and as chairman pro tem of the UPCI Budget Committee. For more than twenty-five years, he served annually as the captain of the Tabulating Committee for the UPCI General Conference. He has also served on the Board of Directors of the Lighthouse Ranch for Boys and as chaplain of the Arkansas State Police.</p><p>Their son, Jim Lumpkin, and his wife, Jelaine, pastor in Little Rock, Arkansas. Their daughter, Mickey, and her husband, Anthony Mangun, pastor in Alexandria, Louisiana.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>At the age of nineteen, Billy married Shirley Ann Kelbaugh in Parkersburg, West Virginia, on December 22, 1953. After moving to Weirton, West Virginia, for work in the laboratory at Weirton Steel, he recognized that God was calling him to preach. They began their ministry by going door to door witnessing. Pastor Allen Cayton came to them after a Sunday morning service and asked, “Why haven’t you told me God has called you to preach?” Later, without notice, Pastor Cayton called upon Billy to preach. After his first sermon, a Catholic lady, whom the Coles had brought to church, received the Holy Ghost.</p><p>The Coles' first major effort was to open a new church in Ravenswood, West Virginia. Not a single Pentecostal resided in the whole county. They began by pitching a small tent and preaching every night for a month, resulting in sixteen adults being baptized in Jesus' name. That church is now pastored by a convert of Brother Cole’s, Reverend T. J. Johnston. There is now a wonderful congregation there, housed in a beautiful new building.</p><p>After pastoring in Ravenswood a few years, Brother and Sister Cole traveled as evangelists. A number of people received the Holy Ghost and were baptized. During this time they also witnessed several notable apostolic events. They then pastored a church in Spencer, West Virginia, with a congregation of one hundred people. The church was debt free when the Coles moved on.</p><p>The Coles were invited to Elyeria, Pennsylvania, to preach for their former pastor, Brother Cayton, who was starting a new home mission’s church. It was while they were here, they felt their call to the Thailand as missionaries.</p><p>In seven years they baptized nearly 6,000 Buddhists and witnessed a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost. One of their first converts, Reverend Chaiyong Wattanachant, has been superintendent of the Thailand churches for more than thirty-five years.</p><p>While in Thailand, Brother Cole suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left arm. The Coles returned to the US. However, upon his being healed, they returned to Asia as evangelists. Thousands were baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost. When Sister Cole became sick, they returned to the US again. When her health improved, they went to Wheeling, West Virginia.The Wheeling church is now pastored by Reverend David Forsythe, an elder mentored by Brother Cole.</p><p>After leaving Wheeling, the Coles returned to evangelizing overseas. When Brother Cole’s father asked him to come home to help build a new building in Parkersburg, West Virginia, he did. When this building was finished in 1981, the Coles moved to Charleston, West Virginia, to pastor the North Charleston Apostolic Church. They have remained in Charleston for over twenty-three years. Three years ago, Brother Cole’s grandson, Reverend Anthony Moss, took over the church upon Brother Cole’s retirement.</p><p>Brother Cole preached many camp meetings and revival services, seeing many filled with the Holy Ghost. The last ten years of his ministry, he preached crusades at home and overseas. On sixteen occasions, more than 3,000 received the Holy Ghost in a single service. The Coles preached for fifty years and were just short of seeing one million people receive the Holy Ghost. They were diligent in training many young men, too numerous to mention, to carry on their ministry.</p><p>Brother Cole served on the Executive Board for two terms, and also served on the Foreign Missions Board.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>In July 1931 Carl Stephenson was born near Nacogdoches, Texas, to Emma and Guy Stephenson. At age ten, Carl was taken to a Oneness Pentecostal church by his grandmother, where he heard the message of New Testament salvation and was baptized in Jesus' name.</p><p>In 1947 Carl attended a revival by Reverend E. L. and Nona Freeman. There he repented of his sins and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, speaking with other tongues. After graduation, Carl worked as an apprentice plumber; then God gave him a preaching ministry.</p><p>In 1949 he was granted a Christian Workers license by the First Pentecostal Church of Kilgore, Texas, and began holding revivals, beginning at Etoile, Texas. He studied and prayed, ate whatever was provided, and fasted often. God blessed his ministry.</p><p>Brother Stephenson received his local license and general license, and he was ordained by the United Pentecostal Church at the Texas District Conference in 1953. He preached in Texas, Louisiana, Michigan, Indiana, and other states.</p><p>In 1954 Carl was married to Nell Walton. In 1955, they moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and he became the pastor of Bethel Tabernacle. During the twelve years in Winnipeg, souls were born again and the church building was renovated. The family grew to include Becky, Kathy, Lisa, and David; all (and their own families) have been born again and continue to serve the Lord.</p><p>Carl served as district presbyter and youth president of the Minnesota-Manitoba District.</p><p>In 1967 Brother Stephenson was elected pastor of First United Pentecostal Church on Greenwood Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The church building was renovated and the established culture of giving was continued. Record offerings were made, especially for Foreign Missions and Sheaves for Christ.</p><p>He was the Ontario District Foreign Missions director for thirty years. He also served on the Foreign Missions Board and made several overseas trips, preaching conferences and dedicating buildings.</p><p>Brother Stephenson taught at Apostolic Missionary Institute for many years, taking a Greyhound bus from Toronto to Picton and, later, the train to London. He taught doctrine, missions, and pastoral theology. He was district presbyter for eighteen years and then district superintendent for over ten years.</p><p>In 1998 Carl Stephenson resigned his pastorate, taking the role of senior minister. This change allowed him to visit more Ontario churches, supporting the local saints and pastors. His Sunday morning Bible class at Greenwood provided continuity and a blessing to all who attended.</p><p>His last two messages were preached on April 6, 2003: “Why Jesus Has Not Yet Come” and “My Greatest Hope: The Rapture.” On April 9 Brother Stephenson unexpectedly passed on into the arms of Jesus, ending a full and rewarding life of ministry.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>E. L. and Nona met January 25, 1937. Love came instantly, though both were in denial about a call to preach and a call to Africa, so that they did not mention it to each other. God called Brother Freeman before his seventh birthday and Sister Freeman at age eleven with the infilling of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>\t</p><p>I collapsed at college in March that year and was sent home from the hospital with thirty-six hours to live. Death came, but during those thirty minutes of time when my heart did not beat and I did not breathe, I met Jesus face to face. I confessed my disobedience and failures and promised to do His will if He would allow me to come back. He graciously forgave me and sent me back. My life turned around at twenty. Because of Bugs apparent lack of spirituality, I immediately broke our engagement, but Jesus has His own beautiful and exquisite ways of working out His will in human lives.</p><p>God later let me know that our marriage agreed with His will, so we were married in August, still keeping our secrets. God said I must be still and let Him guide us. Bugs ambition lay in the business world where he had wonderful opportunities, though he had long sought earnestly for the Holy Ghost. When he decided to surrender to God’s will and preach, the Spirit came on him wonderfully and he talked in tongues for three days. His preaching (and mine) began in a revival in New Mexico, April 1939. In that revival, Jesus told on us about Africa, and from that hour, our predominant thoughts concentrated on GOING.</p><p>Our deep desire to get to Africa moved us to drive from New Mexico to St. Louis, Missouri, in September 1939 (with great difficulties and without needed necessities) to meet the missionary board. They felt insulted (rightly so) that with only five months preaching experience, we would meet them wanting to be appointed to Africa. This was simple ignorance on our part. However, they gave us good advice: “Don’t trade on a missionary call; work for God—hold meetings, start a new work, go through every door God opens—and come back in three years.”</p><p>Without resentment, we took their advice and tried to meet the board again in 1941 and 1942, but they did not have time to see us. By this time, we were pastoring our second church in Louisiana. We asked if we could see them at the Conference in 1943. The meeting would begin at 1 p.m. and end about 6 p.m. If we were there and they had time, they would talk to us. We got to the appointed place at 12:30 p.m. When their meeting ended at 6:30 p.m., they marched out and said, “Sorry, we didn’t have time to talk to you this year; come back next year.”</p><p>My husband immediately began to encourage me to have the right attitude and not resent anything, promising that we when we returned home we would be able to settle everything by prayer. In that all night prayer meeting, God gave me a Scripture verse: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit” (John 15:16). As I read this to my husband, I started shouting. He had received the same verse and finished reading it: “…and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.”</p><p>At a Louisiana district conference in 1944, the missions director announced that we had a missions call. Our precious friend, George Glass Sr., said, “We love the Freemans and do not want them to leave us, but if they have a call to Africa, we need to send them. Bring your gifts to them and put it in the guitar case!”</p><p>Everyone began to weep and most of them made several trips to the case to add to that offering. The war raged then, and America still felt the steely grip of depression, but $3,400 resulted. Three weeks later we received a letter from the board appointing us to Africa, if I could pass a doctors examination on being able to go. When I was fifteen, a doctor had discovered that I had only one lung, but Jesus gave me a new one just in time, so I passed the test. In March 1948, that offering paid the Freemans' fare to Africa on a cargo boat with five children, ages ranging from nine years to six months. There were no planes to Africa then.</p><p>I’ve written books about our forty-one years of adventure in Africa which prove beyond a shadow of doubt that the incomparable grace of Jesus is sufficient for every situation. No matter how ugly or desperate the situation, He is forever able! One of the most amazing things Jesus did early in our journey was guiding Brother Freeman to visit other African countries by faith and claim them for Jesus. Within a short time of his unofficial visits when he walked over that country and claimed it, someone in America would get a burden for that land and GO! Then, speedily, revival’s flame would blaze from unexpected quarters. Speaking of revivals, we saw incredible miracles of healing and salvation in the twenty years of tent revivals that we held, often under very challenging conditions all over the country, a rich reward for the small sacrifices we made.</p><p>All the missionaries that went before us to Africa were sent to Liberia, a small country on the west coast known as the white man’s grave. E. L. Freeman refused to go there. He said, I am not afraid of the climate, but the rest of that vast continent needs the true gospel! He carried an immense burden for Africa, and, after twenty-three years in South Africa, the board handed him the whole continent except for the five countries at the top of it (they fall with the Middle East region.)</p><p>During the time T. F. Tenney served as the missions director, for two years he arranged for us to visit, encourage, and try to open other countries. We continued to do this for another eighteen years after Bug's appointment as regional field supervisor (now known as regional director). We had many more adventures in Jesus' name, trying to open up new areas for the preaching of this glorious gospel, and saw unusual success in that endeavor.</p><p>Somewhere along there, my dearest Bug had to go to St. Louis for a board meeting while I remained in Africa. Jesus visited me in a vision saying, the churches in America are in trouble, the affluence of America has robbed them of their trust in me, and they don’t even realize it. I’m cutting your missionary work short and sending you back to America. Accept every invitation you get to visit the churches and tell them what you have seen me do and what I can do for them.</p><p>When Bug came back, he excitedly told of having the same vision. Shortly after that the Board decided we were getting too old to be missionaries. We knew why! We came back to America in 1989 and together we did what He said for ten years. There were also some visits overseas. Then my darling got the call to go higher in 1999, but before he left me he told me what to do. Keep on doing what you are doing and be happy.</p><p>A near-fatal accident in Kenya, Africa, in 1973 taught us the beautiful message of praise and worship. It still sustains me at eighty-eight as my beautiful daughter, Sandra Freeman lives with me and helps me deliver my urgent message to the family of God; trust Jesus completely and walk in the liberty and power of the Holy Ghost!</p>",

        "biography": "<p>In 1921, when Gerald Mangun was only two years old, five Apostolic preachers came to Lapaz, Indiana, and his mother and father heard the Pentecostal message for the first time. The seed of the gospel found fertile soil. His parents were baptized in Jesus' name and received the Holy Ghost.</p><p>In 1927, at the age of eight, he attended Mattie Crawford’s Miracle Healing Revival in Mishawaka, Indiana, and was baptized in St. Joseph's River in the name of Jesus. In that revival, his sister, dying of diphtheria, was instantly healed. This made a lasting impression on him.</p><p>In 1940 he received the Holy Ghost baptism in a revival in Kokomo, Indiana. Since that momentous day, he has continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine.</p><p>Desiring a greater knowledge of the Word, he enrolled in Apostolic Bible Institute (ABI) in St. Paul, Minnesota. He graduated from ABI and was ordained in 1942 by Brother Norris and Brother A. D. Urshan. He accompanied a Bible school classmate, Eldridge Lewis, to McLeod, Texas, borrowing eleven dollars so that he could travel by train. While in the south, he had a mighty revival in Lou-Ann, Arkansas. Occasions to ministry began to open in Indiana and Ohio, then in Louisiana and Texas.</p><p>He had unprecedented fifty-soul and one hundred-soul revivals in small towns in Louisiana: Starks, Clarks, Eros, and Hodge, then traveled to Diboll, Texas, where one hundred souls were saved and baptized in icy waters. It was there he met a preacher’s daughter, young Vesta Layne Gibson, and promptly felt she was the one he would marry. From that revival he traveled to St. Louis for a great revival and then came back to Texas to marry Vesta Layne, September 10, 1943.</p><p>Together, this dedicated couple traveled from state to state for seven years, experiencing great revival and miracles. During an extended fast, he received the call from Brother Pardue to hold a revival in Alexandria, Louisiana. God spoke to him then: “You’ll be the next pastor of the church in Alexandria, and I’m going to give you the city.”</p><p>On July 25, 1950, this word of prophecy began to be fulfilled. G. A. and Vesta Mangun became pastors of the United Pentecostal Church of Alexandria, Louisiana. Since that time, they have led that congregation in prayer, fasting, witnessing, and discipling, with phenomenal growth and expansion.</p><p>Prayer was his second nature; he often spent days and nights in prayer.  Even today at eighty-five years of age, he still spends no less than two to four hours a day in prayer, ever pursuing a greater degree of intimacy with Jesus Christ! For more than sixty years, he consistently fasted three days each week and went on a seven-day fast at least once each year until cancer surgery at age eighty made this impossible.</p><p>He served as a Louisiana District presbyter for the United Pentecostal Church for fifty-three years, as a member of the Foreign Missions Board of the UPCI for eighteen years, and as executive presbyter for the United Pentecostal Church International.</p><p>For fifteen years he served as chaplain for the Louisiana State Police and as chaplain for the Parish Sheriff’s Department. He was a longstanding member of the Rapides Parish Airport Authority and a member of Alexandria Port Authority. In March 2002 the Louisiana National Guard presented him with a Civilian Service Medal for his service to the community and nation.</p><p>Gerald Mangun and his wife, Vesta, raised one son, Anthony Mangun, who married Mickey Lumpkin. They have two grandchildren, Miquell and Gentry, both in the ministry, and one great-grandchild, Eva.</p>",

In 1907 the Morgans moved to Cravens, Louisiana, where Arthur completed his high school education in nearby De Ridder, Louisiana, in 1918.</p><p>On August 4, 1922, he was united in marriage to Nell Knight in De Ridder.  Sister Morgan became a great asset to his ministry and a wonderful Bible teacher. During the next nine years, they were blessed with four children: Gloria, Mary, Joseph, and A. T. Jr.</p><p>In 1916 a young preacher by the name of Oliver F. Fauss came to the area and began preaching the Oneness message, baptism in the name of Jesus, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Morgans joined their neighbors to learn more about this new doctrine. It was in one of these meetings that young Arthur Morgan heard the Oneness Pentecostal message for the first time. They bought a Bible and began studying Scripture. The message Brother Oliver Fauss preached had a lasting effect on the entire family and played a great part in their later decision to receive the Pentecostal experience.</p><p>It was about three years later, while employed at the De Ridder Post Office, that young Arthur, finding himself under conviction, began seeking the Lord in earnest and received the wonderful experience of the Holy Ghost two weeks later.</p><p>During the years he worked at the post office, he began to feel the call to the ministry. In 1929 he was ordained, and affiliated with the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. Later Brother Morgan became associated with the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance. This ministerial alliance became the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated in October, 1932.</p><p>In 1931 Brother Morgan was chosen pastor of the First Pentecostal Church of De Ridder, Louisiana, and held this pastorate for approximately two years. In 1932 Brother and Sister Arthur Morgan moved to Alexandria, Louisiana, accepted the pastorate of a small, struggling work there, and in the next twelve years built it into a strong, flourishing church.</p><p>The twelve years in Alexandria were ended when he moved back to De Ridder, in 1944, and became assistant postmaster. At this time he was also serving as district superintendent of the South Central District of the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated.</p><p>In 1945 Brother Morgan was called to the pastorate of Faith Tabernacle in Port Arthur, Texas. He gave up all civil service work, and devoted his full time to pasturing the church and to the growing district work.</p><p>He served on the General Board of the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated in its meetings with the General Board of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ to consider the possibility of uniting these two large bodies of Oneness Pentecostal people. After several meetings and much discussion, the final agreement was reached in September 1945, at the General Conference in St. Louis, Missouri. Thus was born the United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>After the Merger Brother Morgan was chosen to serve as district secretary-treasurer of the Texas District. He also served as chairman of the Board of Christian Education, and as a member of the Foreign Missionary Board. Then in 1951, Arthur T. Morgan was chosen as general superintendent.</p><p>Arthur T. Morgan passed from this life while presiding over a General Board meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on October 18, 1967.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>When J. T. Pugh was sixteen years old, he had begun to feel his call to the ministry and, at age seventeen, he enrolled in Southern Bible and Vocational College located in a rural community ten miles from Cisco, Texas. During three of the four years that he attended college, he was pastor of the church in Gorman, Texas.</p><p>In the winter of 1943, Brother Pugh was ordained as a minister of The Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. Upon his ordination, his license was signed by W. T. Witherspoon and S. R. Hanby.</p><p>On August 20, 1944, Brother Pugh was married to Bessie Beryl Halbrooks. She was the first and only girl he ever dated. She bore three wonderful children; Datha Jo, Terry, and Nathanael.</p><p>While the Pughs were still in college and Sister Pugh taught school, they pastored briefly in Hillsboro, Texas. During their short pastorate, the attendance tripled. After graduating from Bible school, Brother and Sister Pugh traveled as evangelists for a short time.</p><p>In 1945 the Pughs were called to pastor in Wichita Falls, Texas. They recalled how on Sunday nights, they would count the money the people had handed them that weekend. If it was more than two dollars and fifty cents, they would walk to a drug store and drink a lime aid. They only bought one drink but asked for two straws.</p><p>From 1946 to 1948, Brother and Sister Pugh evangelized. They later traveled to West Lake, Louisiana, to reopen a work that had been closed. There, their first child, Datha Jo was born. They only stayed in West Lake one and one half years, but God greatly blessed. Brother and Sister Pugh were able to leave eighty wonderful saints behind, a finished parsonage, and a self-supporting work.</p><p>In 1949, at age twenty-seven, Brother and Sister Pugh moved to Port Arthur, Texas, to pastor The First Pentecostal Church. They lived and ministered there for seventeen years. The Lord raised up a strong congregation, and the Pughs built a new parsonage and a new church building.</p><p>In January 1967 the General Board of the UPCI appointed Brother Pugh to fill the unexpired term of Haskell Yadon, as general Home Missions director. After filling that office for six years, Brother Pugh withdrew from it feeling this to be the will of God.</p><p>Brother and Sister Pugh felt it God’s will to go to Odessa, Texas, in 1974, to pastor the First United Pentecostal Church. For nineteen years, they enjoyed revival and growth. During those years, God gave the church a new building with a 1,000-seat auditorium. Also Brother Pugh served the Texico District as their district superintendent.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Howard Goss took the Bible literally as his way of life. Brought to the Lord from atheism, for his first two years as a Christian, he soaked his mind in Scripture, reading nothing else. This laid the foundation for the wise and loving leader throughout his sixty years of ministry.</p><p>In his last Scofield Bible, many key verses in Paul’s epistles are heavily marked, underlined with his favorite red ink, especially those about God’s grace. Maybe because he came right out of atheism, falling fresh into God’s love and grace, he was kept from having any taint of old or inherited religious attitudes or unscriptural doctrinal biases. He was born again, into the liberty in Christ, right from the beginning.</p><p>Texas was where his early ministry years began, and he held many tent revivals in Galveston, Alvin, Houston, and other southern Texas towns.</p><p>Although he chose Texas as his adopted state, he loved to travel on trains. He was personally acquainted with almost all the Pullman porters across the country. Those were the days when the clergy had discounted tickets on all trains. He seldom ate in the dining cars though, carrying his lunches in his suitcase: RyeKrisp crackers, cheeses, salami, and canned Vienna sausages, along with his favorite fruit: apples. His favorite beverage was water, and sometimes milk.</p><p>The passage of Scripture he most often chose as a charge to young ministers who were being ordained into ministry was II Timothy 2:24-25, a portion of which states, “the servant of the Lord must not strive.” His own obedience to these verses was well known but often misunderstood by a few, more aggressive colleagues who enjoyed argument and debate.</p><p>He was never a stingy person but was always giving and compassionate whenever he saw a need with which he could help. Brother and Sister Glass held open house for guests during most of their ministry and married years, since he believed that a bishop must be given to hospitality. More often than not, there would be one or more guests at the dinner table, often occupying the large guest room when the Glasses lived in Toronto.</p><p>Biography of Howard Archibald Goss (1883-1964)</p><p>by J. L. Hall</p><p>Howard A. Goss was the first general superintendent of the United Pentecostal Church (UPC). Converted in 1903, under the ministry of Charles F. Parham, Goss attended Parham’s short-term Bible school in Houston, Texas, in 1905. While riding a train with other Pentecostals in 1906, he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. In the same year, Parham appointed him to be field supervisor of the Apostolic Faith Movement in Texas.</p><p>After moral charges were brought against Parham in 1907, Goss separated from Parham and evangelized in Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, establishing several Pentecostal churches. Goss and E. N. Bell were chiefly responsible for organizing the Assemblies of God (AG) in 1914, and Goss was elected to serve on the first executive presbytery and as the person issuing credentials to ministers in the South and West. E. N. Bell rebaptized Goss in the name of Jesus Christ in 1915.</p><p>After the division of the Oneness ministers from the AG in 1916, Goss served on the credentials committee of the General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies. In 1919 he moved to Canada and established a church in Toronto, Ontario, serving as its pastor until 1937. In the US, Goss was a member of the organizing board of presbyters for the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance and served as the first chairman of this organization from 1925 to 1932. In 1939 he became the general superintendent of the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated. At the merger that formed the UPC in 1945, Goss became the first general superintendent of the new organization and served until 1951. With his wife, Ethel, Goss wrote The Winds of God (1958), a history of the early years of the Pentecostal revival.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Tom Fred was born December 6, 1933, in a home on Pine Street in the city of DeRidder, Louisiana. The summer of 1949, at the age of sixteen, Tom Fred Tenney had an encounter that forever changed his life. Slipping into the back row of the Pentecostal church across the tracks to hear a nun give her personal testimony, he found himself fascinated as the nun spoke for about twenty minutes; then a lady preacher delivered a sermon. He had never heard such preaching. Yet, feeling something he could not escape, he found himself back there the next night. The Holy Spirit was drawing  him, and before school started in the fall, Tom Fred Tenney was a new man in Christ. Almost immediately, he felt called into ministry and service. Opportunities were given for him to speak at youth rallies and fellowship meetings. In 1952 T. F. Tenney was elected Louisiana District youth secretary.</p><p>Tom Fred Tenney and Thetus Caughron were married in West Monroe, Louisiana on December 27, 1952. They have two children, Tom Gregory and Teri Denise (Spears). They have been blessed with five grandchildren and now two great-grandchildren.</p><p>T. F. Tenney was nineteen, and Thetus was eighteen when they were elected to the pastorate of a Home Missions church in Monroe, Louisiana, in February 1953. During their time in Monroe, T. F. Tenney was elected as sectional youth leader. In 1954 he was elected district youth president. He continued in that position until 1960, when he was elected international youth president, a position he held until 1969.</p><p>During the time T. F. Tenney was Pentecostal Conquerors president, the Bible Quizzing program was launched, a number of youth camps across the country were initiated, and youth conventions were founded. The Conquerors Tread was first published under his leadership.</p><p>T. F. Tenney assumed the responsibility of Foreign Missions director in January 1970. That year, Partners in Missions was launched. The School of Missions was begun under his leadership. Short-term evangelistic policies and programs were implemented. Field conferences and regional conferences for missionaries were established. The fields were opened up for more participation from pastors and evangelists to make overseas trips and assist in the work.</p><p>In the latter part of 1975, Pastor George Glass Sr. resigned the church at DeRidder, Louisiana. The church immediately called the Tenneys and asked if they would consider the church. From 1975 to 1978, Thetus and T. F. Tenney served the city of DeRidder, and the people of the First Pentecostal Church.</p><p>The final night of Louisiana Camp Meeting in 1978, C. G. Weeks, who had been the district superintendent for twenty-five years, left the platform and called for an ambulance. By the next day, he had gone to his eternal reward and Louisiana was in need of a leader. T. F. Tenney was elected as the new district superintendent. From that summer day in 1978, through May 1, 2005, the Tenneys served the Louisiana district. He is the bishop emeritus of the Louisiana District and serves as an honorary member of the UPCI General Board.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Oliver Franklin Fauss was born May 22, 1898, in Gage, a small town in northwestern Oklahoma. His family was converted in a Methodist revival meeting when he was just a boy. Many of his memories of his early days are of prayer meetings, revivals and church services.</p><p>Around 1905 or 1906 there was a \"holy-roller\" meeting that was held fifteen miles from their home in Gage. They were curious and traveled the distance by wagon. The \"holy-rollers\" they saw were people who preached and believed this Pentecostal message! Young Oliver Fauss could not forget what he heard and saw in that meeting.</p><p>In March 1911 the Pentecostal message came to Ganado. His mother was the first in the family to receive the Holy Ghost. In September 1911 Oliver received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. A few days later, Oliver’s family moved to Houston, Texas. Once there, they attended church at the now famous Brunner Tabernacle.</p><p>When O. F. Fauss was seventeen years old, he left home to preach. One of his first brush arbor meetings was in Trinity, Texas, in 1915. He also assisted in and attended many camp meetings and revivals in Texas and Louisiana.</p><p>In the late fall of 1915, Oliver Fauss attended a Bible conference held in Elton, Louisiana, that lasted for several weeks. During this meeting, there was much prayer and study on the New Issue and the Oneness of the Godhead. This New Issue was based upon the baptismal formula in Acts 2:38. Oliver Fauss preserved notes taken from Bible studies during the Elton Bible Conference. The truth of the Word of God had come to light, and the Scripture did not teach a trinity of persons in the Godhead but that the Lord our God was one Lord.</p><p>No one in the South had even heard of or believed this message at this point. Then, on December 19, 1915, O.F. Fauss was baptized in Jesus' Name, along with twelve other workers. Robert LaFleur and Oliver Fauss were the first two to wade into a nearby creek and baptize each other. Brother Fauss then baptized Brother S. L. Wise.</p><p>On July 10, 1916, just before going to service in a brush arbor meeting, Oliver Fauss and Miss Jewel Smith were united in marriage. Brother Fauss received his first license to preach on September 2, 1916, from the General Assembly of the Apostolic Assemblies, signed by Daniel C. O. Operrman and Howard A. Goss. He was ordained by the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, by Brother L. C. Hall on August 3, 1917. This ordination bears the signatures of J. J. Frazier, G. T. Haywood, and Brother Opperman.</p><p>The first nine years of Brother Fauss ministry were spent almost entirely in the evangelistic field in Texas and Louisiana. Brother and Sister Fauss traveled, preaching and conducting revivals in small towns, communities, sawmill camps, and settlements.</p><p>Brother Fauss served as chairman of the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ for two years. He served as chairman over at least two annual conferences of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ (now the UPCI). In 1924 he founded the Pentecostal Witness and was editor for four years. He remained on the editorial staff until his death. (The Pentecostal Witness later became The Pentecostal Outlook, which later became The Pentecostal Herald). He was a member of the Board of Presbyters of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ from its beginning. He also served as chairman of the South Central Council of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ for four years.</p><p>In 1944 the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ appointed committees of three to meet jointly and take preliminary steps toward effecting a merger. W. T. Witherspoon, S. R. Hanby, and Oliver Fauss were appointed from the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated. As the Merger was finalized several months later, the official name of the organization became the United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>After the Merger, Brother Fauss held the position of assistant general superintendent from 1947 to 1971. He also served as general superintendent, serving out the unexpired term of A. T. Morgan in 1967. At the 1971 General Conference, he was appointed honorary General Board member and held this position until his death on July 8, 1980.</p><p>He successfully pastored a number of great churches: First Pentecostal Church of Port Arthur, Texas; First Pentecostal Church in Bay City, Texas; Calvary Tabernacle in Indianapolis, Indiana; First Pentecostal Church in Pensacola, Florida; and a church in Newcastle, Indiana. He moved to Houston, Texas, in 1928 with a burden for a work for the name of the Lord.</p>",

There were but few that had turned their lives over to the newfound apostolic experience at that time, so she did not have a large circle of fellowship. Nilah found the secret of daily spending quality time in the presence of God by an old stump nearby to their home. She would brush away the ants and kneel in precious times of communion. At the age of eighteen, she was active full time in the work of evangelism.</p><p>A few years had passed when Sister Charlotte, a twenty-two-year-old nun, came to Nilah's service in Davenport, Iowa, and was drawn to the altar by the powerful, anointed preaching. Sister Charlotte joined Sister Nilah soon after, giving her testimony each night preceding the preaching of the Word. They did this for fourteen years.</p><p>In July 1952 Sister Nilah preached a series of revival services as the first church of Apostolic faith was opened in the province of Nova Scotia. This pattern followed for the next five years, resulting in four new churches being established. Sister Nilah Rutledge was ordained at the 1952 General Conference in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p><p>In 1957 Nilah married a young man, John, that worked with her in the opening of those churches. Along with Sister Charlotte, they traveled across the US holding revival services. In 1959 she returned to Nova Scotia and opened a new church in Amherst. She preached the first revival services in the opening of two other churches in Middleton and Dartmouth. She stayed in Dartmouth and pastored a growing congregation for some thirty years. Doubtless, thousands will walk the streets of gold because of her loyal, consistent, and positive approach.</p>",

Harry was baptized in Jesus' name at nine years of age. The family eventually made Oregon their home. Ellis and Marjorie had felt a burden for India for over fourteen years. They were given missionary appointment and plans were made to travel to India. Thankfully, Harry received the baptism of the Holy Ghost after an all-night prayer meeting in Bend, Oregon, before leaving for India.</p><p>On January 30, 1949, Harry, at fourteen years of age, along with his mom, dad, and sister, Ferne, waved goodbye to their family and friends from the deck of the China Mail, not knowing when they would meet again. The sea voyage of two months took them to many ports in six nations and finally to Madras, India, by the end of March. Harry arrived in India at fifteen years of age to begin a new and very different life.</p><p>Harry was placed in a boarding school in Kodaikanal, South India.</p><p>After completing high school at nineteen years of age, Harry, who had already become involved in missionary work when going to the plains during the school holidays, was appointed as an assistant missionary. As a licensed minister with the United Pentecostal Church and as an appointed missionary, his work began in 1953.</p><p>Following two years of missionary work, Harry, with his family, returned to the US for furlough in l955. He had planned to spend four to five years in Bible college and secular college. At the beginning of the first year attending Conquerors Bible College in Portland, in prayer he felt he should return to India at the conclusion of the first year of study. At the conclusion of the school year, Harry married Audrene Hruza, from Rupert, Idaho. Their honeymoon was spent traveling on deputation.</p><p>In October 1956, they began working in the Bible school in South India. Here their first child, Stanley, was born. They felt the need to evangelize and plant churches in North India. At last, they made the long 2000-mile trip by jeep to language school, where they studied the Hindi and Urdu languages.</p><p>In time, they were able to open churches in North Central India. The Lord blessed them with a daughter, Loretta. They founded Calvary Bible Institute, which over the years has trained hundreds for the Northeast harvest.</p><p>Eventually, Harry and family moved to Manila, Philippines, as this was a central location for the region and travel was easier. Travel was extensive and expensive, so he, with his family, arrived in Portland at midnight from Hong Kong, in January 1976, to raise more support.</p><p>Brother Scism received a call from Robert McFarland, general secretary of the UPC, explaining that with T. F. Tenney’s resignation as general Foreign Missions director, the General Board had appointed Harry to fill the unexpired term. He then asked, “Will you accept this appointment?” Robert McFarland explained that he had to have an answer within two hours. Harry and Audrene moved to St. Louis in May 1976, where many adjustments had to be made.</p><p>After two years of sickness with cancer, Audrene passed away in October 1989. Missionaries and constituents all over the world loved her. The staff at the office was so kind and patient as Harry struggled with grief and heartache.</p><p>On December 8, 1990, Harry Scism and Helen Stewart of Columbus, Ohio, were united in marriage. Helen has been a wonderful wife and has traveled extensively around the world in missionary work.</p><p>For twenty-five years, Brother Scism was privileged to serve as general director. He traveled all over the world meeting precious people everywhere he went. Harry and Helen are now appointed missionaries traveling to different parts of the world in teaching and evangelism.</p>",

Knowing that due to his young age he was not eligible to enter Bible school, he asked for a meeting with the principal, Reverend S. G. Steeves, who was also serving as the first district superintendent of the district of New Brunswick in 1947, just one year after a former full gospel church group had joined the United Pentecostal Church. After this meeting, Brother Steeves asked John Mean to attend the Bible school. After John graduated from the Emmanuel Bible School in 1950, he pastored his home church for a time, then continued in evangelism.</p><p>In 1952, along with the Lewis DeMerchant family, John Mean came to Stewiacke, Nova Scotia, to open the first Apostolic Church in that province. The \"Nilah and Charlotte Evangelistic Team” came to preach the first meetings. Twenty-eight were baptized in the precious name of Jesus Christ during six weeks of revival meetings. The following year he prepared the way for those noted evangelists to crusade in the town of Trenton, where they were threatened with stoning. However, God wrought great victory, and another church was planted.</p><p>In 1953 they preached the first revival as a new church was opened in the town of Truro. In 1954 John came to Halifax with the same evangelistic team, and another church was founded. After three years in Halifax, he and Sister Nilah Rutledge married and visited many churches in the US, holding revival services for two years. In 1959 they returned to Nova Scotia and opened another church in Amherst, then returned to Halifax the following summer. After returning to Halifax, God helped them to build two other churches in Middleton and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.</p><p>Brother Mean served in the district offices of youth president and Home Missions director and served as district superintendent for twenty-six years. He recently retired from the pastorate of the Halifax assembly after approximately forty-eight years. He and Sister Mean visited the missionary fields in Peru, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Pakistan, Wales, and Germany, and they also had the great experience of attending the World Conference in Jerusalem.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Jesse Franklin Williams Jr. was born on August 3, 1927, in the coastal town of Wilmington, North Carolina. His father was a building contractor, and his mother, Anne, was a seamstress. Though they were not really a family of faith, young Jesse was sent to a Baptist Sunday school through his early years. But at the tender age of sixteen, providentially, he encountered the apostolic message. He was baptized in Jesus' name and received the Holy Ghost in 1943.</p><p>Feeling his call and beginning to preach, Brother Williams received his first ministerial license with the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1945. Drafted into the United States Army at the end of World War II, he served as a medic and x-ray technician with the Occupation Forces in Japan, 1946–47, and upon discharge married his sixteen-year-old sweetheart, Sue Collins. Back in civilian life and beginning his family, he continued to work as an x-ray technician from 1947 to 1951, during which time his sons, C. Patton and Michael Jesse, were born.</p><p>Trained in engineering, Brother Williams was employed by the Babcock & Wilcox Company in 1951, served in management there until 1965, and taught evening classes as a part-time instructor at a local community college. Having affiliated with the Assemblies of the Lord Jesus Christ at its inception, he served as assistant pastor in his home church during those years.</p><p>In December 1965, now the father of four, two sons and two daughters, Sue Ann and Fay Elizabeth, life took an extraordinary turn, when Brother and Sister Williams left family and friends to plant a church in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He became a member of the United Pentecostal Church in January 1966, and a new era began.</p><p>A bi-vocational Home Missionary pastor, he was employed as plant engineer for Hercules Steel Company until he left their employment and became a member of their Board of Directors in 1972. Plunging into the work of what was then an emerging district, Brother Williams served North Carolina as Sunday school director, then district superintendent.</p><p>Various tenures as an executive presbyter, assistant general superintendent, and chairman of the Urshan Graduate School of Theology Board have marked his forty-one years of service to the United Pentecostal Church International.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Born the youngest of three children, Lowell Howard Benson arrived November 1, 1915, in Della Plain, Arkansas, to Jim and Pearl Benson. Lowell’s young life was rocked with tragedy in a series of events while he was still just a toddler. His father abandoned the family, leaving his mother with total responsibility for care. Shortly after, she was diagnosed with cancer and died on Lowell’s third birthday.</p><p>The three children immediately went to live with their grandparents, and the family soon relocated to Pocahontas, Arkansas. As soon as he was old enough, he began to help his two sisters on the farm. As a young teen, Lowell discovered that his grandmother had also been diagnosed with cancer. By the time he was fifteen, she knew she could no longer care for him and sent him to live with his oldest sister who was now married and living in St. Louis, Missouri.</p><p>One afternoon while visiting his sister in St. Louis, Lowell entered a store-front revival where he gave his heart and life to Christ. Soon he learned that an old friend from Arkansas was now pastoring a church in nearby Granite City, Illinois. So at age seventeen, he left the life he knew with his sister to live with Brother and Sister Odell Cagle. The Cagles took Lowell into their home with open arms, waking Lowell each morning at 5 a.m. for prayer meeting. About a year after his arrival, the Cagles began to evangelize and hold tent meetings in various states.</p><p>On November 24, 1934, Lowell Benson married Nina Elizabeth King. From the very moment they said I do, the adventure began. For not only had they married each other, they formed a partnership that would join their hearts and efforts together to work for God and grow His Kingdom. The Bensons moved to Fort Dodge, Iowa, with the Cagles to pioneer a new work. Brother Benson soon started preaching revivals and evangelizing all over the country.</p><p>In the summer of 1935, he took his first pastorate in Darden, Tennessee. Fall brought the couple a special gift with the birth of their daughter, Peggy. God called the Bensons to several other works during those early years and gave them a son, Jim, in 1940. Some of Lowell’s endeavors include: pastoring Henry County Tabernacle (Tennessee); pioneering works in Sheffield and Stevenson, Alabama; pastoring in Pritchard, Alabama; and serving as district superintendent of Alabama during the early 1950s.</p><p>After working in Alabama for several years, Lowell and Nina felt God leading them back to Tennessee. In 1953 they moved to Oak Ridge to assist in a new work. Over the next ten years they pastored the West Nashville Church and pioneered a new work in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Brother Benson also served the Tennessee district as Sunday school superintendent.</p><p>In May 1963 the Bensons opened a new work in East Nashville, reaching out to a community that most had forgotten. They faced many hardships and strong opposition, but continued in the work to which they knew God had called them. In the spring of 1979, he was elected district superintendent for the state of Tennessee, and he served faithfully in that position for seventeen years.</p>",

Cook entered the world in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>In the midst of a gathering at Trinity Pentecostal mission, the Holy Ghost fell on him and he began to speak with tongues. He immediately began to feel the call of God for ministry and began by witnessing and participating in street meetings.</p><p>At nineteen years old, he met and married a dedicated young lady. It was during the terrible years of an influenza epidemic that swept the eastern United States following World War I that his young wife died along with their new baby girl just one year into their union.</p><p>It was during this period that R. G. Cook received the revelation of the Oneness of God and baptism in Jesus' name. He began to travel and speak in small meetings across the United States. His travels reached to the southern states and into the Midwest. During his travels in 1921, he met a young woman evangelist named Nelly Jane Reppond from Louisiana. They married and began holding revival meetings throughout Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. In 1922 at the age of twenty-two, they were named pastors of an assembly in Little Rock, Arkansas, that is still a United Pentecostal Church today. After just one year there, they returned to found a church in the Boston area.</p><p>Finding a few believers, they opened a work in Foxboro, Massachusetts. For many years this was the only organized Jesus' Name work in all of New England. While pastoring this work for more than twenty years, he also traveled throughout New England, particularly Maine and New Brunswick, preaching camp meetings and helping emerging works.</p><p>In 1945, S. R. Hanby invited Brother Cook to pastor a church that he had founded in Lancaster, Ohio. Brother Cook led this church for twenty-eight years.</p><p>R. G. Cook served in many official capacities in organizations throughout his years of ministry. He was a district elder with the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. He also served in that role with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ prior to the merger in 1944. When the United Pentecostal Church International was formed in 1945, he was elected as the first district superintendent of the Ohio District and served ten years. He was appointed to the Foreign Mission Board of the UPCI and served nine years until he was elected as the UPCI assistant general superintendent from the Eastern Zone.</p><p>He retired in 1972 from his pastorate and from the office of assistant general superintendent. He continued to travel and minister until the time of his death at age eighty-two.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Frederick E. Kinzie was born to Mr. and Mrs. William Kinzie on February 4, 1914. When he was five years old, his family moved to a farm near Lapaz, Indiana. There, playing with the next door neighborhood kids, Fred met Vera Berger, who later became his wife. They both graduated from Lapaz High School and in 1934 were married.</p><p>Fred and Vera began life together as farmers, fully expecting to farm for the rest of their lives. In 1936 things dramatically changed when they yielded their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They became active in the Plymouth, Indiana, Old Time Religion Tabernacle pastored by Walter D. Mangun. Brother Kinzie became an elder, and Sister Kinzie ministered as a musician in the church. During that time he was superintendent of a non-denominational Sunday school for three years.</p><p>In 1941 Brother Kinzie felt the call to the ministry. In the winter of 1944, the Kinzies took time off from the farm to help Evangelist Earl Gamblin, preaching and singing in meetings in Miami and Pensacola, Florida. Suddenly, rheumatic fever began its throbbing pain in Brother Kinzie while he was driving between the two cities, and he ended up in a hospital in Pensacola, Florida. Finally, in earnest prayer he committed himself to the ministry. That day, Vera wrote letters home informing their folks that they were leaving the farm. The next morning, Brother Kinzie was a healed man.</p><p>Two months later in July 1944, Brother and Sister Kinzie began evangelizing. Pat and Pam McQueen went with them, making a musical team. They sang, preached, and were known as the Kinzie Evangelistic Party throughout the United States and Canada. The group traveled for the next nine years. In 1950, another member was added to the party with the birth of their daughter, Cassandra.</p><p>Brother and Sister Kinzie were honored to be a part of the Merger conference in 1945.</p><p>Many opportunities to pastor churches in states from California to Florida were offered Brother Kinzie while traveling, but the Lord impressed him to \"keep on doing what you're doing.\" His call to Toledo was so definite that doubts never crossed their minds. They arrived in that city in May 1953 and they helped build three church buildings during their pastorate.</p><p>Thirty years later Brother Kinzie turned the church over to his son-in-law, J. Mark Jordan and family. Brother Kinzie serves as pastor emeritus.</p><p>After retiring, Fred Kinzie began writing. Four books were published by Word Aflame Press and many articles printed in the Pentecostal Herald and district magazines.</p><p>On December 16, 2006, Sister Kinzie went on to meet the Lord.</p>",

He wed the pastor’s daughter, Bobbie McElhaney, in 1942. During his senior year at Apostolic Bible Institute (ABI), Brother Crabtree was asked by S. G. Norris to pastor the church in Red Wing, Minnesota. Brother Norris felt that, as a pastor, Brother Crabtree needed to have ministerial license, and he was ordained before even holding a General license. W. T. Witherspoon signed his ordination credentials.</p><p>In 1947 Brother Crabtree was elected pastor of the First Pentecostal Church of Panama City, Florida. The church had been formed through the evangelistic efforts of D. L. Welch, and under the solid leadership of Brother and Sister Crabtree, the church saw tremendous growth. Brother Crabtree’s thirty-five years of pastoral leadership laid a foundation of sound, biblical teaching for the church.</p><p>Brother Crabtree served the Florida District in many capacities. He used to joke that he had held every office but Ladies Auxiliary president. As youth president, he was the principal of the first UPCI youth camp in Florida. Brother Crabtree also served as editor of the district magazine, sectional presbyter, and district secretary. In 1982 he was elected superintendent of the Florida District.

Shortly thereafter, Brother Vittitow joined the Air Force Reserves and was assigned to Michigan. Every weekend he would drive more than two hours each way to attend church in Bay City.

Raised by godly Pentecostal pioneers, his early life was spent in tandem with their ministries. When Norman was eleven years old, his parents founded The Calvary Church in Cincinnati.</p><p>After surrendering to the call of God, Norman attended Apostolic Bible Institute (ABI) in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1977 he married Jeannie Simmons, whom he affectionately called “the brunette,” and they returned to Cincinnati that year to begin working with Norman’s parents at The Calvary Church. Norman was ordained by the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) in 1980.</p><p>Norman faithfully served The Calvary Church as youth pastor from 1977 to 1992, and as senior pastor from 1992 until his death on March 24, 2018. Humorous and transformational preaching and an unending love for people were hallmarks of his leadership. He spent countless hours connecting with the congregation and community through counseling, personal Bible studies, and by simply being present at their celebrations and in their difficulties. He impacted the Cincinnati region as a police chaplain, and he was the first UPCI minister to become an FBI chaplain.</p><p>Norman Paslay served the Ohio District as youth secretary for one year and as youth president for fourteen years. He preached over one hundred youth camps throughout the US. He discipled hundreds of young people for thousands of hours while serving as a Bible quiz coach from 1981 to 2018. During that time his teams won eleven national championships, and he was selected as coach of the year three times.</p><p>Reverend Norman Paslay II served the UPCI as director of Media Missions, helping to innovate ways of broadcasting the gospel and to establish My Hope Radio. Norman was a member of the Global Missions Board from 2006 to 2017; during that time he helped raised over $203,000 in monthly support for missionaries and participated in the creation and promotion of the I AM GLOBAL offering. He also served on the Ministers Appeal Council. Norman was on several church and educational boards, including ABI, Urshan Graduate School of Theology, and Purpose Institute.</p><p>Pastor Paslay facilitated Jonathan Ministries, designed to support young ministers with their practical financial needs. He wanted the next generation to know that he trusted them. “Trusted,” was the title of the message that Norman Paslay preached at the 2017 Ohio District Camp Meeting. It was the first and only message he would preach as the Ohio District UPCI Superintendent, but it would encapsulate the message of his life.</p><p>Norman and Jeannie had four beautiful daughters, and he applied the same principles of investment and intentionality seen elsewhere in his life and ministry with his family. “I want to be remembered for the way I did family,” he said. His daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren continue his legacy of investing in people and the kingdom of God. His son-in-law and daughter, Tom and Kristen Ellis, now serve as pastors of The Calvary Church.</p>",

On September 23, 2005, Brother Williams married Doris Gary.</p><p>In 1940 at the age of twenty-one, Brother Williams and his family attended service at a one-room school house. There he wept and repented of his sins. In Cane Creek, Brother Stubblefield baptized him in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. After that, the Williams family started attending a community service at a place called Upper Sinking. During this revival, God filled him with the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Next, the Williams moved to Nashville, then on to Memphis, where they became members of the First Pentecostal Church with Pastor E.E. McNatt.</p><p>During the first decade of Brother Williams’ ministry, three churches were started in Tennessee.  In 1945, in Ridgely, Tennessee, he was given approval to take the church to a building that had been vacant for some time. Brother Greer, with funds provided by one of his friends, bought the building, and there Brother Williams began his pastoral responsibilities. Later a building became available in Tiptonville, a few miles away, and he began to preach there also.</p><p>Near the end of Brother Williams’ time in Ridgely, God began to deal with him about Union City, some thirty-one miles away. He experienced many challenges in building the church in Union City. However, God always had a plan. Brother Williams’s faith was being built through each obstacle.</p><p>While in Tennessee, O. W. Williams was elected to several district offices, including presbyter. In 1953 he felt the call to go to Kilgore, Texas, and accepted the pastorate there. He served in Kilgore for six years before moving to Houston. In Houston a church was built that seated 1,100 people.</p><p>For fourteen years the Williams labored at Stonewall, until the fellow brethren of Texas elected him to the office of district superintendent. It was during his tenure that the current tabernacle on the campgrounds in Lufkin, Texas, was built.</p><p>Brother Williams served as superintendent for three terms. At the end of the third term, he felt a call back to pastoral ministry. In December 1976 he assumed the pastorate of Eastview United Pentecostal Church in Lufkin.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Jack was born March 28, 1928, and spent his early life in Herrin, a small mining town in southern Illinois. He was the youngest of five children (three boys and two girls). When he was ten years old, he moved with his parents, Raymond and Della Yonts, to Glendale, Illinois. His father, Raymond, pastured a small church in this town. Four years later the family relocated to Indiana. At that time Jack went to live with his uncle and aunt, T. J. and Loraine Miller, who pastored a thriving church in Muncie, Indiana.</p><p>In 1945 Jack accompanied his aunt and uncle who were moving to Toledo, Ohio, in order to pastor a small church. In the fall of 1947, he enrolled as a student at Apostolic Bible Institute (ABI) in St. Paul, Minnesota. While attending ABI, God called Jack into the ministry. He was nineteen years old.</p><p>Jack Yonts and Jo Ann Whitaker married in July 1948. She became the love of his life and his life partner in ministry. They raised a beautiful family of four children (three girls and one boy).</p><p>The young couple began to travel, conducting revivals for two years. By 1953 they were ready to settle in one place, and began a Home Missions church in Connersville, Indiana. They labored there for two years, and then moved to Muncie, to serve as assistant pastor.</p><p>In 1955 Jack became the pastor of the Pentecostal church in Hartford City. He served the congregation for seven years until the fall of 1962. He served as district youth secretary (1955–60) and as district Home Missions director (1960–62).</p><p>The family moved again in the fall of 1962. This move took them from Indiana to Madison, Wisconsin, where they pastored for nine and a half years. Brother Yonts served as district Home Missions director for one year and as district secretary for eight years. Significantly, it was here where his passion for reaching the lost and clear understanding of the needs of home missionaries birthed Christmas for Christ, in December 1963.</p><p>The spring of 1971 took the family to Appleton, Wisconsin. Impassioned with the ministry of Jesus Christ, they began a Home Missions church in their home. Beginning with just their family members, the work grew to become a revival church with a congregation of up to 200 during the six and a half years they labored there. While in Appleton Brother Yonts served as regional Home Missions director for two years and as district superintendent for four years.</p><p>At the 1977 General Conference, Jack Yonts was elected as general Home Missions director. During his sixteen years in that role, New York Metro District was birthed and he served as its superintendent for six years during its development. Also the Central Canadian District was formed and he served as its district superintendent for three years.</p><p>Jack Yonts oversaw the first Black Conference in Houston and the first Spanish Conference in New York, both held in 1978. Additionally, the first National Growth Conference was held in St. Louis. Metro evangelism was clearly the heartbeat of his burden and administration. Numerous metro missionaries were selected and supported, and the home Bible study, a simple and effective soul-winning tool, was promoted across the US and Canada. He was also a significant participant in the development of the home Bible study, Exploring God’s Word.</p><p>As Jack approached the age of sixty-five, God called the Yonts to the great mission field that is Chicago-metro. Armed with prayer, dedication, and the simple Word of God, Jack and Jo Ann once again started a church in their home using the home Bible study, Exploring God’s Word.</p><p>Jack Edwards Yonts Sr. has been a part of the Executive Board for sixteen years and the General Board for thirty-three years (thirteen of those years as an honorary member). He has authored a two-volume multimedia teaching series, Passing the Mantle.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Arless Richie was born to Robert N. and Allie Glass on August 17, 1929, in DeRidder, Louisiana. At birth the doctor said that he could not live, so they placed him in a dresser drawer and left him. Soon a close neighbor was allowed in the room, and she asked, “Where is the boy?” Their answer was, “In the dresser drawer; he’s dead, or dying.” The neighbor took Arless from the drawer, detecting life, gave him to a nurse and said, “Take care of him! God has a great work for him to do!”</p><p>At age eleven he went to work at the Realart Theater. Upon graduating from high school, Arless was promised a football scholarship. He hitchhiked to the college and was about to enter the registration office when a voice spoke to him: “Why not wait until the spring semester to enroll?” The voice was so strong he turned and walked out and the first car that passed gave him a ride home. Before the spring semester, God filled him with the Holy Ghost.</p><p>After joining the Air Force on his twenty-first birthday, Brother Glass was stationed at Craig AFB, Alabama. Deployed to Okinawa for two years, he baptized ninety-five people in the wonderful name of Jesus. After coming back to the states, Arless married Geraldine (Geri) Gill June 16, 1953. They became the parents of three children, Cathy, Letha, and Rich, and were blessed with six grandchildren. After forty-two years of wonderful marriage, Geri died of cancer.</p><p>Two years later Arless married JoAnn Cannon, widow of Reverend Clyde Cannon. JoAnn was the Ladies Ministries president of the Louisiana District. Arless inherited another daughter, Becky Davis. After six years JoAnn passed away from a heart attack.</p><p>Two years later Arless married Joan Carouthers, widow of Reverend Kelton Carouthers, adding another son and daughter, Mark Carouthers and Karen Jenkins.</p><p>Stationed in Alabama in 1951, an ice storm prevented Brother Glass from meeting the District Board. They mailed him his local license, and in July 1953, he was ordained at the Louisiana Camp Meeting. On October 16, 1953, Brother Glass was discharged, drove home, unloaded the car, disconnected the trailer, repacked, and left the next day to go to Alexandria, Louisiana, to begin revival. He also earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from Texas Bible College (TBC).</p><p>In November 1956 the Glasses accepted the pastorate of the UPC of LaMarque, Texas. After nearly six years, God spoke to Arless and said, “I want you in Pasadena.” For forty-six years, he has remained in the city of his calling.</p><p>He has been involved in many programs and offices: Sunday school director of the Houston section; one of the founders of TBC; district Foreign Missions director; regional Home Missions director; Evangelism Commission; member of the TBC Board of Directors; TBC instructor; Lt. Col. CAP, auxiliary, USAF; police chaplain in the Pasadena Police Department; superintendent of education, endorsing agent for Military chaplains; founder of the UPCI Chaplaincy program; organizer of the Association of Christian Teachers and Schools (K–12); one of the founders of Urshan Graduate School of Theology. He also received an honorary doctorate in Pentecostal Studies from Apostolic Bible Institute; received a master’s diploma in Apostolic Studies; served as a member of the Texas District Board, the South Texas District Board, the General Board, and the Board of Education; was a member of many committees, both district and national; assisted in rewriting the Judicial Procedure; was listed in Who’s Who in 1978 and Who’s Who of Executives and Professionals in 2007; and was chosen by Who’s Who to be one of the ten professionals to be featured on their web page at no cost.</p>",

He has well served the Apostolic movement as a teacher, pastor, preacher, editor, writer, district superintendent, theologian, and historian.</p><p>During his tenure as editor in chief, the Pentecostal Herald proclaimed the Apostolic message worldwide, and the Forward provided valuable resources for ministers. The selection of Word Aflame Press books grew from a mere handful to over 150 in print on a variety of biblical, ministerial, and practical subjects. He actively supervised the approval and editing of all periodicals, tracts, books, and Sunday school literature. He was also instrumental in organizing the first Oneness Pentecostal symposium, overseeing the Historical Center (now the Center for the Study of Oneness Pentecostalism), formulating the Judicial Procedure, and chairing the Parliamentary Committee.</p><p>Brother J. L. Hall is widely respected both inside and outside the Oneness Pentecostal movement as one of its foremost theologians and historians. He contributed several articles for The New International Dictionary of the Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements (2002), including the one on the UPCI, and is the only living Oneness leader to be the subject of an article in it. Often, as an insightful General Board member, he has played a key role in dealing with theological issues, constitutional and judicial matters, and difficult decisions in our movement. Leaders have valued his advice as sound, unbiased, and uninfluenced by personal agendas. He is a kind, gracious, steadfast, and articulate spokesman for the Apostolic faith.</p><p>With an uncompromising faith in the Word of God, Brother J. L. Hall has constantly challenged the modern Pentecostal movement to follow its natural impulse of biblical understanding in doctrine and experience. Brother J. L. Hall and his lovely wife, Margie, were married for over fifty-six years. Brother and Sister Hall’s sons, Gerald and Ron, are UPCI pastors in Michigan, and their daughter, Diana, with her husband, Warren, lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>F. Wesley McKenzie was born in Jamaica, West Indies, on September 22, 1929. He attended public school there, and was raised in a local denominational church. However, he longed for more of God than he found there. He left home in 1949, to seek employment in Kingston, the capital city.</p><p>Arriving in Kingston, he discovered that the cousin to whose home he had come had recently obeyed the truth, so it was not long before Wesley followed his example. He was baptized in Jesus' name and received the Holy Ghost under the ministry of Reverend Ralph Reynolds at Pentecostal Tabernacle on Wildman Street in Kingston.</p><p>In 1955 he married Margherita Hunt, who was also a member of Pentecostal Tabernacle. This union produced four children: Granville, Desmond, Elise and Heather. Brother McKenzie was always a lover of education, and his desire to pursue higher education led him to migrate to Toronto, Canada, with his family in 1967. They attended First United Pentecostal Church and all four children were born again there, during the pastorate of Reverend Carl Stephenson.</p><p>In 1971 a job transfer made it necessary for the family to move to a small town west of Toronto. Their first visit was to Weston UPC, located in the west end of Toronto. The main prayer request that day was for a new pastor, as their current pastor had accepted a position elsewhere. Up to the time of his departure, no replacement had been found, so the church board asked Brother McKenzie if he would consent to being the regular Sunday morning speaker, which he did. After some months, with still no pastoral applicants, the board suggested to the district superintendent, Reverend J. O. Moore, that he ask Brother McKenzie to consider applying for a local license and becoming the pastor of the church. He prayed about it and finally agreed.</p><p>Following what he felt to be the direction of the Holy Spirit, Brother McKenzie spearheaded two sessions of the “Enroll to Grow” Sunday school outreach program. The result was an urgent need for relocation, as the congregation grew to 120 in a building that seated ninety-six! A nearby movie theatre came up for sale, and the Lord moved miraculously in various ways to allow the church to purchase this building in 1985. As the church continued to grow, the need for another relocation became evident in 1997, and God, again by many miracles, provided the present location at 1901 Jane Street. Preparing for the move, the church felt the need for a new name that would more accurately reflect its character, experience, and history. Faith Sanctuary was chosen.</p><p>Pastor McKenzie was ordained to the ministry in July 1979. He taught courses part time for several years at Apostolic Missionary Institute and was a member of the Ontario District Board from 1992 until his death. He also served on the Editorial Board of the UPCI and on the Ministers Appeal Council. He travelled to the mission fields of Brazil and the Philippines and ministered in several other places. He was a great believer in spreading the gospel through daughter works, and this policy still continues today at Faith Sanctuary. One of Pastor McKenzie’s fondest dreams was for the church to own a senior citizens residence, and this desire was fulfilled as part of the deal for the present property.</p><p>On the morning of March 3, 2003, after a four year battle with cancer, Brother Kenzie passed from this life.</p>",

Brother and Sister Vouga were in Hawaii in 1926, as the first Apostolic Pentecostal missionaries to Hawaii—over thirty years before Hawaii became a state. Brother Vouga served four years as a missionary to Hawaii, taught in Bible school, and evangelized and pastored in many areas of the United States and Canada.</p><p>Brother Vouga established a solid church during his stay in Winnipeg, with many families sharing in his very competent ministry. It was while he was in Winnipeg that he was elected to the office of assistant general superintendent, and he left shortly after to take up residence in Indianapolis, Indiana. He later moved to Pritchard, Alabama, where he pastored for seven years before moving to St. Louis to assume the responsibilities of the Foreign Missions director of the UPC.</p><p>His was one of the strong voices that helped to establish the gospel message that we love and appreciate today.

        "biography": "<p>On May 2, 1930, Robert Daniel was born to Martin and Josephine Whalen at their home in Columbus, Ohio. His father was a staunch Roman Catholic and his mother simply a Protestant with no religious affiliation.</p><p>When “Bobby” was three months old, his mother received the Acts 2:38 experience, much to his father’s dismay. However, a year and a half later, his father was baptized in Jesus' name and filled with the Holy Ghost, speaking with other tongues. They attended the Apostolic Gospel Church pastored by W.T. Witherspoon.</p><p>Robert Whalen was privileged to grow up under the dynamic teaching and preaching of his much loved and respected Pop Witherspoon. When he was eleven years old, he gave his first Bible study during a daily Vacation Bible School. At the age of twelve, he was baptized in water and at the age of fourteen was baptized with the Holy Ghost.</p><p>In October 1948 Brother Whalen enrolled in the Apostolic Bible Institute, where he again sat under a master teacher, Brother S. G. Norris. It was here he met Gerry Kelly, the love of his life, and they were married by Brother Norris on August 5, 1950. They graduated together in 1951 but remained in St. Paul another year for Brother Whalen to take a post-graduate course. During that year their first child, Sally Jean, was born on December 16, 1951.</p><p>In the fall of 1951, he received his first license with the UPC, a general license through the Ohio District, signed by General Superintendent Howard Goss, Assistant General Superintendent Oscar Vouga, General Secretary Stanley Chambers, and Ohio Superintendent Ralph G. Cook.</p><p>In the spring of 1952, after much prayer, he moved his little family to Ohio, while waiting on God to open a door—but every door closed. After preaching a few revivals and weekend services and doing odd jobs, he attended the General Conference in Little Rock, Arkansas. There, he was introduced to Brother C. A. Nelson, Oklahoma District Superintendent, who immediately said, I have a church for you in Oklahoma. Very reluctantly, Brother Whalen agreed to preach for the little Home Missions church in Ardmore. That weekend the Lord miraculously let him know without a shadow of a doubt that this was to be his field of labor. The Whalens moved to Ardmore in November 1952. He was ordained into the ministry at the Oklahoma District Conference in Claremore in March 1954 by Assistant General Superintendent Oliver F. Fauss.</p><p>While in Ardmore, two more children were born to the Whalens: Patricia Lea on December 5, l954, and Robert Stuart on July 2, 1958. When their baby boy was just four days old, Oklahoma Superintendent M. D. Deal called to tell Brother Whalen he had been unanimously elected pastor of the Southeast UPC in Oklahoma City. Having the assurance that this was the will of God, they began their pastorate in Oklahoma City in August 1958, and continued there until retiring January 1, 1996.</p><p>At their first sectional conference R.D. Whalen was elected to a sectional office and thereafter almost continually held an office. He served as sectional youth secretary and youth leader, then district youth secretary. In 1962 he was elected district presbyter, continuing in this office until elected district superintendent in 1983. He remained superintendent for eighteen years until he retired in 2001.</p><p>Before becoming district superintendent, Brother Whalen was the first elected executive presbyter of the South Central Region in 1977, at the General Conference in Indianapolis.</p><p>Since 1983, he has been on the Tupelo Children’s Mansion Board of Directors, serving as vice-chairman of the board during Brother James Lumpkin’s tenure as chairman. Although now retired from most positions, he is honored and humbled to be pastor emeritus of his former congregation, now the Southern Oaks UPC of Oklahoma City, and to be an honorary member of both the Oklahoma District Board and the General Board of the UPCI.</p>",

While pastoring, he served as Youth President of the Louisiana District.</p><p>In the late 1950s, Brother and Sister Craft preached a nine-week revival in Jackson, Mississippi, where Reverend W. E. Gamblin was the pastor. Sherri Layne, the Crafts first child, was born August 20, 1958. In January of 1962, Brother Gamblin called to see if the Crafts would pray about moving to Jackson.</p><p>Two weeks before they moved to Jackson, their second child, Vonda Lynn, was born. They relocated to Jackson on July 29, 1962. The sixties was a marvelous time for revival. The church quickly filled to capacity and beyond.</p><p>Sherri is married to Reverend Mark Grisham and Vonda is married to Reverend Chris Tharp. Brother and Sister Craft have four granddaughters, one grandson, and three great grandchildren.</p><p>A new Colonial style church was built at 3425 Robinson Road in 1970. It wasn’t long until it was full. Then God gave an even bigger challenge to Brother Craft. He had attended the funeral of Reverend Clyde Haney and the Lord spoke to him about reaching His world from one place. The desire to train young men and women began to grow in his heart. Little did he realize God was preparing his future for Jackson College of Ministries.</p><p>Proceeding JCM, an event occurred that changed the apostolic landscape. Brother Craft and Brother Kenneth Phillips were directed by God to have a Preaching and Prayer Conference. By word of mouth, over 250 preachers attended this conference. For three nights and two days they preached and prayed. What a dynamic move of God! The next year they had around 900 preachers who attended what they then called Deeper Life Conference. Conferences broke out all over the UPCI fellowship and to this day there are many similar conferences being held.</p><p>Local Music Conferences began in Jackson. An Evangelism Commission was begun after Deeper Life Conferences.</p><p>Missions, foreign missions in particular, has been his soul’s sincere desire. He has preached around the world twice, going east to west then west to east preaching crusades in many countries. He would be gone many weeks at a time and come home to a church having revival. Many great revivals began overseas with these crusades.</p><p>Pentecostal Bible Institute in Tupelo, Mississippi, moved to the Mississippi campgrounds in Raymond. Brother Craft purchased the charter and began Jackson College of Ministries in 1976. The college moved from the campgrounds to a facility in North West Jackson. This was the first Bible College to offer five different degrees: Theology, Missions, Music, Christian Education and Religious Studies. He remained President of JCM until 1997.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Freddie Jean Foster was born December 28, 1926. His Father and Mother were John Wesley and Ruby Foster. His younger and formative years took place in Durham Community, Rodger Mills County. The tough and devastating Dust Bowl and the Great Depression caused the family to move to the North Valley-Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1936.</p><p>At the age of sixteen, Fred joined the US Navy. He served aboard the minesweeper USS Vigilance. Fred left the ship then for Military Government School at the Presidio, in Monterey, CA.</p><p>While going to the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and participating in the athletic program, Fred and his future wife, Pat, came to God the same night, April 1948, in the pastorate of W.H. Massengale during an A.W. Hicks revival. Fred, feeling a call to preach, transferred to Pentecostal Bible Institute (PBI) in Tupelo, Mississippi.</p><p>PBI summer school students, 1949, held a brush arbor meeting. After two weeks they were going to close it down, so Fred and another student decided to continue with many coming to God. They resolved to start a church. Pat joined in this endeavor after their marriage on September 10, 1949. This was the beginning of Cedar Grove Pentecostal Church. Brother and Sister Foster went back and preached the 50th Anniversary.</p><p>In September 1954, the Fosters founded Calvary Pentecostal Church. While there, Brother Foster felt the call of God to begin a Bible college in the Texas District where he had never ministered.</p><p>In 1958, the Fosters became pastor of the Orange, Texas, Border Street Church (now First United Pentecostal Church). Sizable growth and a Saturday Bible School for area preachers were developed. Brother and Sister Foster went back and preached both the 75th and 85th anniversaries of the Orange Church.</p><p>Brother Foster was founding president of Texas Bible College and it was a phenomenal success from its beginning.</p><p>Brother and Sister Foster and their family were elected pastor of First Pentecostal Church, West Monroe, Louisiana in January 1970. The Fosters made sure the church was UPCI all the way, by the church giving liberally to all departments, district and international.</p><p>After relinquishing the pastorate to his son Mark, Brother Foster redirected to other works of ministry; writing, speaking, etc. He was also challenged by his three years at Jackson College of Ministries, and enjoyed the presidency of that college.</p><p>In 1965, Fred Foster and Edwin Judd became the first General Conference Parliamentarians at Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><p>The Foster’s children serve UPCI pastorates: Mark, West Monroe, Louisiana; Tom, Dallas, Texas; and Debbie and her pastor husband, Steve Saiz, Torrance, California. They have one deceased son, Tim.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Born into the passionately Christian family of Levi and Sophie Haney on May 14, 1912, Clyde was the third child to come into this union. His mother had received the Holy Ghost a few years before his birth, and by the time he joined them, the family, along with Brother Harry Morse, had followed the revelation of the Oneness of God and Jesus Name baptism.</p><p>When Harry Morse moved to begin a work in Oakland, California, Clyde’s father, Levi Haney, took over the leadership of the work in Stockton. This church, along with a group of churches that came together, experienced unprecedented revival in 1921.</p><p>When Clyde was fourteen, his father decided to leave the family. At this time, Clyde was very pleased when the chance came to work with his sister and brother-in-law on their ranch up in the foothills above Stockton.</p><p>When Clyde became ill, the doctor’s dire prediction was that he was going to die and that no doctor or medicine could help him.  It was then Clyde surrendered his life completely and totally to Jesus Christ and he was instantly healed. He began to follow the Lord with a sincere desire to minister in some effective way.</p><p>In 1933, he met Olive Gray, whose parents were dedicated missionaries to the country of Japan. She had traveled to Stockton, to further her Christian training. Married in July of 1934, their family was complete when several years later, four children were added one by one to the circle; Kenneth, Shirley, Evangeline and Joleane.</p><p>In their early married life and during the depression years, Clyde and Olive traveled from Arizona, to Missouri, and back, helping churches and pastors along the way, while sacrificing themselves at every turn.</p><p>Upon returning to Stockton, they worked seasonally picking fruit and also helped in the church, Harmony Chapel, pastored by Brother Van Buskirk. Feeling the need for more formal education, they moved to Oakland, California, to attend Pentecostal Training School led by Harry Morse. Determined not to waste this opportunity, it was here that Clyde Haney learned the value of ministerial and Biblical training.</p><p>In 1938, after moving his family to the foothills to be closer to his work, Clyde got a job building roads and was soon asked to be the preacher at a small community church in the nearby gold mining town of Paloma, California. Although they eventually moved back to Stockton to resume helping Brother Van Buskirk, they faithfully continued to visit and hold services for the group in Paloma.</p><p>In 1940, feeling the leading of the Lord, they moved to Pasadena to not only pastor the people there, but to also experience great growth and erect a new building during wartime when it seemed impossible to do so. That church is still standing today.</p><p>However, it seemed that Brother Haney’s home, Stockton, was to be his destination as six years later he was summoned by telegram to return and take the work there. He pastored there for twenty-five years, built two more church sanctuaries, two Sunday school wings and an overflow building on site.</p><p>Brother Haney founded a Bible College in 1949, in the basement of the Harding Way Church. Over time, he built nine buildings to facilitate it. In its sixty years of existence, over 6,000 students have passed through the doors of what was first known as Pentecostal Bible School, and then was later christened Western Apostolic Bible College. Today this institution still stands and is known as Christian Life College.</p><p>Adding a high school and eventually an elementary school, he worked hard overseeing and assisting in the construction of a total of fifteen buildings during his ministry. His devout service record included a stint as Youth Director of the Western District of the UPCI, and he founded the first Western District Youth Convention held in Carlsbad, CA. He capably filled the roles of assistant pastor, evangelist, pastor to three fine churches, and Bible College founder and president.</p><p>Clyde Haney passed from this life on October 14, 1971, at the age of fifty-nine, following a tragic automobile accident while hunting. His memorial service was held in the final church he built on Cherokee Road in Stockton.</p><p>Once again, he made the trip to the foothills he loved so much. Such fitting surroundings for this man with an inherited pioneering spirit, whose life and teachings helped to strengthen and ground this great organization, the United Pentecostal Church International.",

Their romance continued into college and they were married in 1923.  He enrolled in Ohio State University, majoring in Business Administration, working nights at the Western Union.</p><p>Drawing on his sales experience, he joined the National Cash Register Co. Soon he became the branch manager. While under the pastorate of W. T. Witherspoon, Brother Norris became a preacher and developed a great love for the Word of God.</p><p>The Norrises had five children: James, Mary, David, Eleanor and Ruth. Life was wonderful.</p><p>After moving to New York City, he established a church there. He gained spiritual strength that lasted a lifetime.</p><p>He was commissioned by Reverend Witherspoon to pastor the church in St. Paul, Minnesota. This church had fourteen previous pastors. Into this atmosphere, he moved his family to 464 Pierce St, St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1934.</p><p>October 1, 1937, Apostolic Bible Institute began. It was housed at Midway Tabernacle, the church he pastored. The foundation of this school was the Word of God. Invincible biblical truths were placed in the lives of students.</p><p>Their faithfulness led to growth. God opened the doors at new locations for Midway Tabernacle and the ABI before miraculously providing the present campus at 6944 Hudson Boulevard. Reverend Norris pastored Midway Tabernacle and officiated as the ABI president and simultaneously served as the Superintendent of the then North Central District. Later his responsibilities also included serving on the board of the UPCI.</p><p>He published the former Pentecostal Outlook, and wrote inspired doctrinal tracts: Gospels, Acts and Epistles, The Mighty God in Christ and others.</p><p>He also developed detailed Bible charts of the Tabernacle Plan and the Book of Revelation. These were designed in large sizes (approximately 12x 24) and required a series of studies.",

She was the sixth and youngest child.</p><p>She recognized the voice of the Lord and at the age of thirteen in Dequincy, Louisiana, she received her call to preach the Gospel. She was licensed by the Louisiana District Board in July 1955, by Superintendent C.G. Weeks</p><p>As a fully appointed missionary to the island of Jamaica, she and her parents arrived on January 23, 1956. Her Dad was the pastor of Pentecostal Tabernacle and Superintendent of the United Pentecostal Church of Jamaica. Her Mom was the Bible school teacher. She was the evangelist and also served as an assistant to her Dad. During their tenure on the island, thirteen church buildings were built in eleven years.</p><p>Wayne Trout and Janet were married in August 1958, by Brother Howard Goss. For the next two years, they pastored the growing church in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1960, they started driving one hour south to hold Bible studies in the home of John and Ruby Hopkins.</p><p>They resigned the Wilmington Church and moved to Dover, on April 17, 1961. Their son, Anthony, was ten months old. For a year, they rented a VFW Hall and then in 1961, they bought property and built the first building; it was finished and dedicated on Thanksgiving 1961. On July 1, 1964, their daughter, Jeanette, was born.</p><p>In 1965, there were two families driving the long distance to Dover from Oxford, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. This led the Trouts to start Bible studies in the home of Emma Carter in October 1965. The Bible study attendance grew and they rented a Grange Hall to accommodate the growing church. When they outgrew those facilities they moved to the Bayview Council Hall to have space for Sunday School classes.</p><p>The church grew and they bought property and built a church in the town of North East, Maryland, on Route 40, in 1972. They have enlarged the building twice and built a large Family Life Center adjacent to the church.</p><p>In 1967, the Dover church congregation had grown and they bought three acres of property north of Dover. Here, they built the second building and dedicated it on Thanksgiving 1968. Later, an educational building was added to the structure. In 1975, with an urgency to provide a Christian education for the church children, Kent Christian Academy was founded with 105 students the first year.</p><p>During the Bible college years, The VIEW (Video International Evangelizing the World) program was developed as a Biblical training tool that continues today as the core curriculum for Bible schools around the world. In 2005, Sister Trout was a major player in the establishment of the International Biblical Institute in Jerusalem and Jordan.</p><p>In 1995, Brother and Sister Trout resigned from the Dover church and their son, Anthony, was elected Pastor. The church has since built a new building and continues to grow under Pastor Anthony’s leadership. Brother and Sister Trout continue to pastor the North East, Maryland church.</p><p>In December 1998, Sister Trout started Bible studies in Georgetown, Delaware. The first building there was bought in 1999. After the renovations were complete, it was put on the market and sold. The church rented for three years and then bought a second property with the proceeds from the sale of the first property.</p><p>Brother and Sister Trout have written and recorded over 75 songs and Sister Trout has written eight books.</p><p>Brother Trout served as District Superintendent for the New Jersey Delaware District for twenty-five years. He currently serves as an honorary board member on both the district and national boards of the United Pentecostal Church. Sister Trout serves as the Home Missions Director for the New Jersey-Delaware District UPCI and the National Director of the Amish-Mennonite Ministry. She is the Treasurer of the Board of Trustees and a founding board member for Urshan Graduate School of Theology.</p><p>In recognition of high scholastic achievement, Sister Trout was inducted into the Sigma Beta Delta, the International Honor Society in Business, Management, and Administration by Wilmington University with a 4.0 GPA.",

Ruby received the baptism of the Holy Spirit at age twelve or thirteen, and remembers the age of fourteen as a time when she settled a lot of things with the Lord and determined to go all the way with Him.</p><p>The family began traveling in evangelistic work when Ruby was seventeen. She was the speaker and the other children would sing.</p><p>In 1940, Ruby began traveling on her own and received her General License with the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated. She made many good friends who believed in the oneness of God. Among them were the Ellis Scism and Ernest Moyer families. They shared scriptures with her and she was baptized in Jesus' Name.</p><p>Ruby was a part of the United Pentecostal Church since its merger in 1945, and was ordained around 1948, at the insistence of Howard Goss.

He was the son of Robert Olen and Nellie Fay Parkey.</p><p>In 1934, C. P. Kilgore held a revival in the Randolph Community and Olen and Fay Parkey received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  From that time on, the family was involved in the apostolic movement and was part of the Pentecostal Church.  In 1940, W. C. was baptized in Jesus Name and in 1941, at the age of ten, he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>W. C. graduated from the Moore, District 66 grade school, and in 1949, he graduated from the Paoli, Oklahoma High School.  In 1954, he graduated from Oklahoma University in Norman, Oklahoma, with a B. A. degree with a major in history, and a minor in English.</p><p>In 1953, while a Junior at O. U., he was given his ministerial license with the UPC and became the Secretary of the Oklahoma Youth Department and in 1955, became the President of the Oklahoma Youth Department and continued in this position for the next eight years.</p><p>Shortly after graduating from O. U., he preached his first revival in Hope, Arkansas.  In September of 1958, he became pastor of the Oneness Pentecostal Church of Sperry, Oklahoma.  He was pastoring the church without a wife, until September 23 1961, when he married Betty Lou Morgans, of Claremore, Oklahoma.</p><p>In 1962, Pastor W. C. Parkey and the Sperry Church started a daughter work in Independence, Kansas.  Also, in 1962, Brother Parkey had become a member of the Radio Commission that was attempting to start a radio broadcast called \"Harvestime\".  At the Dallas, Texas, General Conference the first broadcast of Harvestime was aired.  The special song on the first 'Harvestime' broadcast was a song written by author W. C. Parkey, \"Don't Let Me Forget (What the Lord's done for Me).”</p><p>On February 7, 1963, Elizabeth Elaine was born to the Parkey Family.</p><p>In December of 1963, Brother Parkey resigned his church to become the Promotional Director of the Harvestime Broadcast at the United Pentecostal Church headquarters, at 2645 South Grand in St. Louis, Missouri. During this year, he not only traveled promoting Harvestime, but also he was the editor for the periodical \"Harvest-Home\".  At this time, he was serving as the editor of the Youth Magazine, \"The Conqueror's Tread!”.</p><p>In 1964, he became pastor at The First Pentecostal Church of Kansas City, Missouri, where he served for ten years. At this same time he was the editor of the Missouri District publication, The Missouri District VOICE!</p><p>On December 30, 1965 Barbara Lois was born to the Parkey family.</p><p>In 1967, the Missouri District voted to have a Bible School.  The name, \"Gateway College of Evangelism\" was chosen, and W. C. Parkey was asked to be the president. During this time he was asked to serve both on the Curriculum Committee and the Board of Publication of the United Pentecostal Church.  He also served on the Campus Evangelism committee.</p><p>On November 7, 1968, William Robert was born to the Parkey family. On October 27, 1972, Bryan Henry was born.  Then in 1974, Brother Parkey was asked once again to return as the president of Gateway College.  By this time, it was obvious that in order to guide the school efficiently and effectively it could no longer be a part-time job; so reluctantly, Brother Parkey resigned as pastor to become the President of Gateway College.</p><p>In his second term as President, a high school and distance learning program was added.  Gateway sponsored a trip to the Holy Land and a publication, called \"The Panorama,\" was instituted with W. C. Parkey as the editor.</p><p>In 1980, he became the pastor at First United Pentecostal Church of Poplar Bluff, Missouri.  A new church building was built and in 1983 Cornerstone Tabernacle was dedicated. During his time in Poplar Bluff, he served one term as Executive Presbyter of the UPCI, becoming a member of the General Board and the Executive Board.</p><p>In the year 2000, his son, Bryan Parkey, became his co-pastor at Cornerstone Tabernacle.  In 2002, Brother Parkey retired as pastor and was given the title of Bishop by his church.  Since that time, he has completed a book on Proverbs entitled \"Treasures and Truths\", has completed and published a book of poetry entitled, “Sentimental Journey”, and has completed the manuscript of a book on Ecclesiastes, called \"Devotion and Duty\", which is ready for print.",

There was no insincerity in him at all. He was real. He never put his family on the back shelf; they were on his calendar before anyone else.''</p><p>He was a leader of leaders, a man of impeccable character, known for his wit and wisdom, but first of all, a Christian in the truest sense of the word. As the epitaph inscribed on his monument reads, ''He served his generation well.''",

During the 1940s, Ernest attended church most of the time in either a brush arbor, a tent, or a store front.  It was a wonderful heritage of pioneer Pentecostal evangelism.</p><p>Ernest received the baptism of the Holy Ghost June 19, 1948, and was baptized in the name of Jesus two days later. He began to feel his call into the ministry when he was sixteen.</p><p>In 1957, he went to the Apostolic Bible Institute in St. Paul, Minnesota.  At ABI, he met Wally Ann Bierschenk from Louisville, Kentucky. They were married August 23, 1958. In 1959, they moved to Frankfort, Kentucky to build a church there. It was there in 1960 that their daughter Lori was born.</p><p>In 1962, he returned to ABI as an instructor and also pastored the daughter church of Midway Tabernacle in St. Paul Park, Minnesota. The ministry of teaching Bible College students was very fulfilling and meaningful. From there he moved to Apopka, Florida and pastored the United Pentecostal Church where in 1965, their daughter Lisa was born.</p><p>In 1968, he was elected to the pastorate of the Apostolic Church in Belleville, Illinois. This was a thriving church with many receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Gateway College of Evangelism began in 1968 and for its first three years he served as an adjunct faculty member.</p><p>In 1972, Brother Breithaupt was elected to be full-time District Secretary of the Illinois District. This opened a door for him to labor in the organizational work of the United Pentecostal Church fellowship; something for which he had felt a calling placed on him from God. He felt strongly that a Spirit-directed, unified church structure would be a vital part of the end time evangelization effort of the people of God.</p><p>He was elected to be the District Superintendent of the Illinois District in 1981. He held this position for twenty years during which time he initiated the Illinois Ablaze program and led the district in establishing Chicago Metro Evangelism.</p><p>In 1989, he was appointed to the Budget Committee of the General Board and continues to serve there. In 1991, he was authorized to start a Home Missions church in Bloomington, Illinois.

When Arthur was two, his father died, leaving Julia to tend their farm. A year or so later, Julia married a widower, John Lee, who worked for the Santa Fe Railroad in Ft. Worth, Texas.</p><p>While Arthur was still in elementary school, his step-father moved the family to Walnut Springs, Texas, where John found employment with the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The Clanton family quickly joined the Baptist Church and became active members. In 1931, at age sixteen, Arthur graduated from Walnut Springs High School, one year ahead of his class.</p><p>Later in the summer of 1932, Arthur Lee Clanton received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.  He immediately became involved in street evangelism - both in Walnut Springs and other nearby towns. He joined other young people to attend revival services almost every night, where they would help with music, singing and altar work. Soon, he was joining \"evangelistic parties\" for revivals in the hills and prairies of nearby Texas towns. At age seventeen, he preached his first sermon in a small community called County Line.</p><p>In 1937, Brother Clanton was called to be the pastor of the church in Rosepine, Louisiana. It was there that he met Grace Lance, whom he would later marry. In 1938, at age twenty-three, Brother Clanton was ordained into the ministry with the Pentecostal Church Incorporated.</p><p>In 1940, Brother Clanton left Rosepine, to serve as assistant pastor of the church in Alexandria, with Brother A. T. Morgan. About a year later, he was asked to move to Houston, Texas, to assist Brother W. E. Kidson as editor of the Apostolic Herald at the PCI headquarters. It was during this time that he and Grace Lance were married in February, 1942.</p><p>In May, 1942, Brother Howard Goss, Superintendent of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated, asked Brother Clanton to consider the pastorate of a church in Shreveport, Louisiana, a position he held until late 1947, at which time he returned to Alexandria, Louisiana, to assume the pastorate there. It was while in Alexandria, that Brother & Sister Clanton's first son, Charles, was born.</p><p>Brother Clanton wrote more than fifty gospel songs. The most well-known of these include “I Know I'm Saved” and of course, “My Thanks To Him”. It was in 1951, while in Shady Grove, that Stephen, the Clanton's second child was born.</p><p>At the General Conference in 1955, held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Brother Clanton was appointed Editor-in-Chief of the UPCI, a position he held until his untimely death on February 2, 1976.  In addition to his editorial duties, he also single-handedly wrote the Adult Sunday School manual for several years, and was the author of a number of tracts. In 1970, after several years of exhaustive research and writing, the original edition of his book, United We Stand, was published.",

Theresa went to ABI and graduated before Bennie arrived from New Brunswick, Canada in 1959.  He acquired a private pilot’s license, married Theresa and graduated in 1962. After a three year pastorate in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1965, this couple journeyed to Manaus, capital of the huge Amazon state in Northern Brazil with their six month old daughter, Beth, where they studied Portuguese and built the home in which they still live.</p><p>In 1970, Sheaves for Christ helped Brother DeMerchant purchase a Cessna 172 seaplane that still flies after 10,000 hours, which is more than a million miles.  A larger Cessna 206 was purchased in 1977 and has logged 5,000 hours. When he is not flying seaplanes, Brother DeMerchant evangelizes using a fleet of wooden and aluminum canoes, portable cement block forms and hundreds of trained workers as they plant churches in Amazon cities, towns, villages, on islands, lakes, and among Indian tribes.</p><p>Manaus has a present population of about two million souls with some 200 United Pentecostal Churches. A UPCI convention center has been built on the north side of the Amazon River near the floating seaplane hangar and accommodates up to seven thousand people for special events.</p><p>Theresa DeMerchant, national director of Bible schools, coordinates the work of translating, printing and the curriculum for eighty-two Bible school locations with 292 teachers.

        "biography": "<p>Frank J. Ewart was born in 1887, in Bendigo Victoria Australia. His father was Scotch and his mother was of Irish descent. He received his first credentials to preach from the Baptist headquarters in Winnipeg, Canada and began his ministry as a bush missionary.  He had only preached for the Baptists a short time when he heard about the outpouring of the Holy Ghost.  After hearing about a large camp meeting in Portland, Oregon, he decided to attend.</p><p>It was not long until he was gloriously filled with the Holy Ghost and spoke in several known languages, some of which were interpreted that night. After he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1908, he was dismissed by the Baptist organization.</p><p>In 1911, he became the assistant pastor to William H. Durham in Los Angeles, California. After Brother Durum’s death in 1912, Brother Ewart became the pastor. In 1913, he heard R. E. McAllister preach at the Arroyo Seco camp meeting on water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.   In April of 1914, Brother Ewart and Glenn Cook re-baptized each other in the name of Jesus.</p><p>Jesus Name baptism became known as the “new issue”. The revelation of the name of Jesus brought a great crisis in his life, but being the editor of a paper named Meat in Due Season, he used it to spread the glorious news of what God had revealed to him.  Persecution became severe, but from that day until his passing, he was a staunch supporter of the great Truth of God being manifested in the flesh and baptism in the name of Jesus.  He said the year that he received this great experience of the infilling of the Holy Ghost at camp meeting in Portland Oregon, Christ stepped out of the mist of theological speculation and became the greatest reality of his life.</p><p>He wrote hundreds of faith-building and inspirational articles and was the author of a number of books, the last one being the Phenomenon of Pentecost, a history of the latter rain, which was written in 1946.</p><p>Frank Ewart died in 1947 at age seventy-one. His closest friend, Harry Morse, preached the funeral service in Monterey Park just outside of Los Angeles, in the church where he preached during the final years of his ministry.",

        "biography": "<p>James Merrill Kelley was born on February 16, 1929, in Brownsburg, Indiana, near Speedway where he later graduated from Speedway High School.  A few years later in April of 1950, never imagining what God had in store for him, he was invited to a United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>It was there, at The Bible Church in Indianapolis, Indiana, where James heard the gospel for the very first time.  He thrived under the excellent teaching of Pastor James Petty.  Later, under Pastor James ''Pop'' Simison’s leadership, love and ministry he quickly bonded with the church.</p><p>After being baptized in Jesus Name and receiving the Holy Ghost, he became involved in ministry and committed himself to a life of service.  This commitment has been a thread throughout his ministry and his life.</p><p>With a desire to obey the call to go into full time ministry, Brother Kelley pursued his study of the Word at the Apostolic Bible Institute in St. Paul, Minnesota.  He began holding revivals around the country and pastored in New Castle, Indiana.</p><p>While serving in The Bible Church in Indiana, Brother Kelley met the love of his life, a woman who had a heart for God and ministry as much as he did, Eleanor Gray Bess. They married in 1959.</p><p>The Bible Church was growing and needing a larger facility. Brother Kelley drafted and designed a new building.</p><p>In 1962, the Kelleys were elected pastor of Christ Apostolic Temple in Weirton, West Virginia. Their son, Jonathan, was born in early 1963, when the family moved to West Virginia. During their pastorate in West Virginia, the Kelley’s had another daughter, Crystal.</p><p>While traveling through Washington, D.C., Brother Kelley felt a call to start a new work in the area.  In 1967, he and Sister Kelley began holding Bible studies in the basement of Colonel Hubert Nolde’s home.  After several months, he moved his family of five from West Virginia, to establish the first United Pentecostal Church in the Washington D.C. Metro area.  Shortly thereafter, the Kelley’s were chosen to be one of the first recipients of the new Christmas for Christ program of the UPCI.  They moved from the basement of Colonel Nolde’s home to a small house in Alexandria, Virginia, and later purchased a church building in Arlington, Virginia, which became home to a strong, vibrant church. During this time, another daughter, Rachel, was born.</p><p>Creating a daughter-church approach to metro evangelism, Brother Kelley seeded several churches in neighboring areas with ministers from his local congregation, planting members in these neighboring areas to help support these works.</p><p>While pastoring in Arlington, Virginia, James Kelley became the Superintendent of the Virginia District, continuing in this position for twenty years.  Under his oversight, the district grew from six churches to approximately forty-seven.</p><p>In 1992, Brother Kelley retired as bishop of Capital Worship Center, now pastored by his son and daughter-in-law, Jonathan and Charla Kelley in Centreville, Virginia.",

She later learned of the Acts 2:38 message through Brother Robert Glass, the grandfather of Cumberland, Maryland, UPC pastor, Richard Glass.</p><p>On February 7, 1952, at age twenty-seven, Ilda was baptized in the river at Mount Savage in Cumberland, Maryland.  Her husband, Arthur, was baptized with her.  After fasting for six days, she received the Holy Ghost.  Many in her family came to the Lord after hearing her testify of her salvation to them.</p><p>Sister Wolford started the Apostolic Pentecostal Church of Jesus Christ at Job, West Virginia, in 1965.  The church became affiliated with the UPCI January 25, 1967.</p><p>The church was started in the old Job schoolhouse.  In 1968, work began on a new church building on property they had donated.  Sister Wolford’s husband, Arthur, bulldozed the land to prepare the site and six women dug the footers.</p><p>When God called Sister Wolford to preach she only had an eighth grade education and she told the Lord, ''I can’t read those big words.''  She said the Lord told her to ''preach the Gospel''.  Sister Wolford removed her coffee table from her home and built the pulpit from the wood of the coffee table.</p><p>Reverend Lloyd Garlitz preached the first revival at the church.

        "biography": "<p>Harry W. Branding’s experience with God started in 1928, while on a business trip in Florida. Upon his returning to St. Louis, he visited the church pastored by the late Benjamin Hite and in time obeyed Acts 2:38. He served as assistant pastor to Brother Hite for approximately four and a half years.</p><p>On April 13, 1935, Harry W. Branding became the pastor of a mission at 11th and Hickory. After eighteen months, the congregation purchased the Bethlehem Congregational Church located at 13th & Gravois. Sometime afterwards, the name changed to Apostolic Pentecostal Church.</p><p>By the late 1950’s, the church at 13th & Gravois (as it came to be known) needed repair. Brother Branding and the congregation decided to move to Grand Avenue, near Longfellow and Hawthorne. Time passed and the plans did not mature. Finally, Brother Branding heard the voice of the Lord saying that the church had not been released from the 13th & Gravois location. Consequently, the old building was demolished by the men of the church. The work on the new building started immediately after major repairs were made to the foundation. In the fall of 1958, the building was finished and presented to the Lord.</p><p>In September of 1945, something very special took place. The Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ (PA of JC) and the Pentecostal Church, Incorporated (PCI) merged to form the United Pentecostal Church. A year earlier, Brother Branding, a PCI member, visited the PA of JC’s General Conference being held in St. Louis, at Whiteway Tabernacle where Brother Walter Guinn pastored.</p><p>Brother Branding suggested to Brother O.F. Fauss, ''Why don’t we get together?''</p><p>Brother Fauss liked the idea and soon a resolution was passed which extended an invitation to the P.C.I. to explore the possibility of merging. In the spring of 1945, representatives from each group met and agreed on the fundamental doctrine and name of the new organization. In September, both organizations agreed on the terms and the merger was complete. On April 15, 1945, this church affiliated itself with the UPC.</p><p>In 1948, after the passing of B.H. Hite, Brother Branding became the District Superintendent of Missouri. He served in that capacity until 1969. One of his accomplishments during that time was the erection of a district campground. Another of Brother Branding’s accomplishments as District Superintendent of Missouri was the establishment of Gateway College of Evangelism in 1968. The campus was located at 3155 Charbonier Road in Florissant, Missouri.</p><p>Harry W. Branding departed this life on September 8, 1969. His passing left a tremendous void throughout the fellowship. At his memorial service, Brother Branding was eulogized as a spiritual giant, a great patriarch and a just man.",

At the time of his birth, his father, Oliver F. Fauss, was already a well-known and successful minister in the rapidly growing Oneness Apostolic movement.</p><p>Orlin was only one year old when his parents moved to Houston to begin Bethel Tabernacle. For the first five years, the Bethel Tabernacle Church did not have a home. Most of these years were spent worshiping under tents, brush arbors, in public parks and rented halls.</p><p>He grew up participating in the establishment and growth of Bethel Tabernacle. After graduating from Milby High School in Houston, he attended and graduated from Apostolic Bible College in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While at Apostolic Bible College, Brother Fauss traveled and did evangelistic ministry. During this time, he traveled with the Apostolic Quartet that consisted of James Kilgore, Roland Gardener, and John David Williams.</p><p>On August 8, 1945, Orlin married his childhood sweetheart from Houston, Lois Ivey. She joined him to finish his last year of Bible College. After the birth of their first son, Deryl, on December 26, 1946, he and his wife entered the full-time ministry as traveling evangelists.</p><p>Brother and Sister Fauss served as pastor in churches in Diboll, Texas, Nacogdoches, Texas and Jena, Louisiana, before moving to Houston. During this period of time, their other sons, David and Gary, were born.</p><p>Brother O. R. Fauss and his family moved to Houston in January 1961, to assist his late father, Oliver F. Fauss, at Bethel Tabernacle. Just shortly after moving to Houston, his father experienced serious health problems and Orlin took over the full responsibility of pastor.</p><p>Because of the growth experienced under his leadership, in 1976 a new sanctuary was built. For over fifty years Pastor and Mrs. O.R. Fauss served Bethel Tabernacle in pastoral ministry.</p><p>On September 12, 1964, tragedy struck the Fauss family when their oldest son, Deryl, was killed in an automobile accident at the age of seventeen. He had just received the Holy Ghost a few weeks before at a youth camp in Lufkin, Texas. This tragic event profoundly shaped the ministry of Brother Fauss with a new vision of eternity and desperation to reach men with this saving message of Jesus Christ.</p><p>In addition to serving in pastoral ministry and preaching large meetings, Brother Fauss also served as the first Youth President of the Texas District United Pentecostal Church. He served for many years as an instructor at Texas Bible College. He also served for seven years on the United Pentecostal Church International Sunday School Curriculum Committee and served many years on the first Historical Committee for the UPCI, helping to preserve our rich heritage.</p>",

Wendell’s character and musical abilities so impressed the faculty and student body, he was elected honor student at the close of his freshman year. S. G. Norris, president of the college, asked Wendell to join the faculty while he was still a student, and he taught at ABI for the next thirty-five years.</p><p>Brother Gleason never pastored a church, but his dynamic teaching and Godly life influenced many pastors and missionaries who attended ABI. He taught Minor Prophets, Bible Geography, Life of Christ, and Book of Acts, and directed both the college choir and the church choir. For twenty years he toured the United States with choirs and quartets, representing the school and developing countless friendships. In 1955, he was the first to produce a record for a UPCI Bible college: “I Know a Name,” featuring student Hugh Rose. He served as executive vice president of ABI for ten years and as the secretary of the Minnesota-Manitoba District of the UPCI for twenty years.</p><p>Wendell Gleason was a loving husband to Rea and a good father to his four children, Gary, Pat, Pam, and Stan. His two sons became pastors and district superintendents, while his two daughters became pastors’ wives. His younger son Stan now serves as the assistant general superintendent of the UPCI.</p><p>Brother Gleason retired in 1981, and he and Sister Gleason moved back to Oregon City, Oregon, where they attended the United Pentecostal Church pastored by his son, Gary. That same year, he was elected district secretary of the Oregon District and served for ten years.</p><p>Brother Gleason had retired in name only. Besides his duties as district secretary, he often spoke at churches throughout the Oregon District and the country, conducted music seminars, and taught his Minor Prophets course on video for Kent Christian College. He served as executive presbyter for the Northwest Region for two years.</p><p>On March 23, 1997, the hope of eternal glory to which God had called Wendell Gleason and that about which he so often had sung, became a wonderful reality.",

        "biography": "<p>Edwin Judd was born in Oregon, on May 7, 1923, to parents that had embraced the Apostolic faith in 1912. He was baptized in the name of Jesus at fourteen years of age and received the baptism of the Holy Spirit at the age of sixteen. He married Evelyn Minor in 1943.They had two children, Donna and Stephen, both of whom are actively involved in ministry to this day.</p><p>He served two years in the military during and following World War II with sixteen months overseas in India, Burma and China, serving most of this time as a chaplain’s assistant.</p><p>He graduated from Pentecostal Bible Institute, Tupelo, Mississippi, with a Bachelor of Theology and from Cascade College, Portland, Oregon, with a Bachelor of Arts in Education. He was granted Local License with the UPC in 1947, and was ordained in 1951.</p><p>He served five years as Dean of Faculty at Pentecostal Bible Institute. During this time, he pioneered a rural church near Shannon, Mississippi.</p><p>He served twelve years as Dean-Registrar of Conquerors Bible College, Portland, Oregon, and two years as President of CBC.</p><p>During the late ‘50s and early ‘60s he was Sunday School Director of the Northwestern District. At the same time, he authored the entire Adult Teacher’s Quarterly for several years. While involved at Conquerors Bible College, he pioneered the UPC in Oregon City, Oregon.</p><p>As an outgrowth of his exposure to the work of missionaries while serving overseas, from his early days in Bible College he felt definitely called to become a strong promoter of the foreign missionary cause as part of his ministry. Throughout his nineteen years of Bible College ministry, he was instrumental in keeping the challenge of the Great Commission constantly integrated into the entire Bible College program. Consequently, a relatively large number of former students became and still are missionaries at this time.</p><p>He was appointed as a pastoral member to the Foreign Missions Board in 1963, and has served continuously for 49 years.</p><p>In 1968, he resigned his Bible college presidency to become the first Promotional Director of Foreign Missions with the mandate to introduce the Faith Promise Concept of foreign missions support throughout the UPCI.</p><p>Soon after assuming this position and with the assistance of many, he was instrumental in designing the Partners In Missions program and with the approval of the Foreign Missions Board and General Board, introduced this program of missionary support in the 1969 General Conference.</p><p>In 1972, he became the first Regional Field Supervisor for the Latin American Region which encompassed all of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean Islands.</p><p>Upon the retirement of Paul H. Box in 1976, he was appointed as General Secretary of Foreign Missions and served in this capacity for twenty-one years until his retirement in 1996 at the age of seventy-three.</p><p>Upon his retirement, the Judds took up residence in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and became active in that church where Stephen Judd was pastor. When Stephen Judd was called to become the President of Tupelo Children’s Mansion in 2001, they gladly moved to Tupelo where they had lived for eight years at the start of their ministry. Since that time he has filled an active role on the staff at Tupelo Children’s Mansion, serving a number of years as Comptroller and now as Human Resources and Payroll Manager and Senior Advisor.</p><p>He is an active member of Life Church – Tupelo and occasionally ministers in the pulpit as preacher and Bible teacher.</p><p>Early in 2004, his beloved wife of over sixty years passed on to her eternal reward. While Evelyn was not personally involved in the limelight of public ministry, she was a faithful, loyal, and dedicated companion in ministry, always willing to make any sacrifice required to do the will of God wherever He called and to whatever work.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Daniel Lee Scott, a third generation Oneness Pentecostal, was born July 31, 1932, in Chesapeake, West Virginia to John and Naomi Scott. At age five, he appealed for water baptism and was baptized by his pastor at the time, Claude G. Holstein. Brother Scott’s mother, often called, ‘The Praying Lady,’ was a formidable force that molded his spiritual life. His early years were spent on the family farm with contentment, working alongside his father.</p><p>Life continued without major change for the next eight years, when he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost at age thirteen, and shortly after, was called into ministry.</p><p>Preaching consistently over the next five years in revivals, special youth services and fellowship meetings, he was joined in marriage in 1950 with Joretta Jordan, who became a valuable part of his ministry. Evangelizing on the Eastern seaboard, they traveled to bring the gospel to hungry hearts. The Scott family consists of two sons; Daniel Jr. and Benjamin Jordan, and two daughters; Neva and Deborah. Their first son, Donald Everette died shortly after childbirth.</p><p>In 1958, he was elected pastor of the Open Door Apostolic Church in Charleston, West Virginia, and in 1959, was elected as the East Central District Youth Secretary and in 1961, as the president, serving in this capacity until he and his family were called to Ecuador as missionaries. The West Virginia District Youth Camp property was purchased and the first phase of the camp was constructed during his administration.</p><p>In 1968, during the general conference convening in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Scotts were appointed as missionaries to the country of Ecuador. He served under Edwin Judd and Paul Leaman as the Regional Field Supervisors and in 1972, was appointed as the field superintendent.</p><p>By 1977, he suffered a serious illness contributed to parasites and was unable to return to the field. Later that year, Brother and Sister Scott founded the Cross Lanes United Pentecostal Church, Cross Lanes, West Virginia, and served as the pastor over the next nine years.</p><p>In 1980, in conjunction with his work in Cross Lanes, he began assisting Lewis Morley in establishing Spanish Ministries in North America and in 1981, due to Brother Morley’s deteriorating health, he was appointed as the Field Representative for the General Home Missions Division to the Spanish Culture. In 1986, because of the tremendous growth of the ministry, the General Home Missions Director, Brother Yonts, requested that the Scotts devote full time to the development of Spanish ministry. The General Board appointed the Scotts to initiate a national pilot program for Spanish Evangelism Ministries in the Western District, working under the district leadership of Superintendent Paul Price. Brother Scott resigned the pastorate in Cross Lanes and moved his family to Los Angeles.</p><p>In 1992, Jack Yonts requested Brother Scott to accept the responsibility of the entire Ethnic Ministries program, and in so doing within a short while he was planning and implementing six major conferences on an annual basis. In 1995, the Scotts moved to World Evangelism Center to administrate the rapidly growing Spanish Ministries Program.</p><p>By 1996, praying in the chapel one morning, Brother Scott sensed another change in ministry, and returned home to speak with his wife that he felt God was calling him back to South America. That call was realized when he was appointed the Regional Director of the South America Region, and he served in that position until the election of Bruce Howell as the General Director of Foreign Missions in 2002. By request of Brother Howell, he was appointed as his Executive Administrative Assistant; a position Brother Scott counts as the crowning service covering his ministry of 66 years.</p><p>Brother Scott has authored nine published books. Though retired from active service due to his loss of hearing, he continues to minister both at home and abroad, and serves World Evangelism Center in whatever capacity he is needed. One of his greatest joys is continuing as a guest teacher for the Urshan Graduate School of Theology.",

        "biography": "<p>Douglas Davis was born in Newton County Texas on November 14, 1932, to very humble circumstances. He was the third child of an Apostolic Pentecostal minister. He received the Holy Ghost in 1941 at the age of nine in a revival service in Buna, Texas where Nona Freeman was the evangelist.</p><p>He recognized a call to spiritual ministry early in life and at age seventeen began traveling extensively with his brother, Cecil, as an evangelistic team - playing his guitar, singing, and preaching the gospel. In 1950, at the age of eighteen, he received ministerial license with the United Pentecostal Church, International and was officially ordained by the UPCI in 1957.</p><p>On September 3, 1951, Brother Davis married Betty Bond in Haynesville, Louisiana in a ceremony performed by L. J. McDaniel, pastor of the Bossier City, Louisiana United Pentecostal Church. The newlyweds continued in the evangelistic ministry for several years.</p><p>In 1953, the Davises founded a church in Henderson, Texas. Brother Davis ministered faithfully, successfully building the Henderson church. During these years, their first son, Doug Jr., was born.</p><p>Early in 1954, the Davises relocated to South Bend, Indiana, where Brother Davis became the Assistant Pastor and Minister of Music at Calvary Tabernacle United Pentecostal Church. He served in this capacity for five years, and while there, the Davises’ second son, Dan, was born.</p><p>In 1958, the Davises moved to the city of Fort Worth, Texas to start another church. They purchased a small storefront building, and while living there, remodeled it into a presentable church. Just a few years later, the church was able to purchase a new property consisting of two church buildings, a sizable parking lot, and a house.</p><p>In less than ten years, the congregation of the Fort Worth church had grown from just a handful, to more than one hundred fifty members and had moved from holding services in a storefront to worshipping in a beautiful, new sanctuary. During this time, Pastor Davis was elected to serve as a presbyter on the Texas District Board of the UPCI.  He was thirty-five and his wife was thirty-two. The family became complete in 1960, when Curtis, the third son, arrived.</p><p>The Fort Worth church was thriving and Pastor Davis’ ministry was successful and respected. But in spite of this apparent success, he began to feel an inescapable call from God to establish yet another church. In 1968, that divine call led D. D. Davis to resign the pastorate of the Fort Worth church, and his duties on the Texas District Board, and move his family to Long Island, New York to establish a new church in the Empire State.</p><p>The challenge of establishing a new church in the New York metropolitan area was almost overwhelming. During those beginning years of sacrifice and struggle to birth a church in Long Island, Brother Davis received several offers to accept the pastorate of larger and more established churches, but he was convinced that it was God’s will for him to remain on Long Island.</p><p>Today, forty-five years and five remodeled buildings later, the continued growth of Bethel United Pentecostal Church (presently located in Old Westbury, NY) is an ongoing testimony to the effective ministry of this steadfast and dedicated man with a Godly vision. The church presently owns a twenty-acre campus with three buildings, (featuring a sanctuary that seats 1000 people) valued at close to ten million dollars.</p><p>During the years that he was laboring to establish Bethel, Brother Davis faithfully supported and served the United Pentecostal Church organization through various district and national offices - serving as a presbyter in the Eastern District, Superintendent of the New York District, presbyter in the New York Metro District, Global Missions Director of the New York Metro District and as a member of the UPCI Minister’s Appeal Council. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Kent Christian College.</p><p>As a writer, he has authored numerous Adult Bible Lessons for Word Aflame Publications. In 1986, he became a member of the Global Missions Board of the UPCI and at the time of this writing, continues to serve as an honorary member of that board.</p><p>Their son Doug Jr., is the Senior Pastor of the church in Old Westbury, NY; their second son, Dan, is the Senior Pastor of First United Pentecostal Church of Baton Rouge, LA; and their son, Curtis, is the Director of Christian Education and Data Operations Manager of Bethel UPC in Old Westbury, NY.</p><p>He currently serves as Bishop of Bethel UPC in Old Westbury, providing wisdom and direction to the ministerial staff as well as to the rapidly growing congregation. He continues to travel overseas on behalf of the Global Missions Division of the United Pentecostal Church, International, never wavering in his vision and faith for the Church around the world.",

        "biography": "<p>Bishop Haywood received the baptism of Holy Ghost February, 1908. The makeshift church was a converted tin shop and was led by Elder Henry Prentice, who had received the baptism of the Holy Ghost at Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Here, G.T. Haywood and his wife, Ida, were gloriously filled with the Spirit and began their spiritual training.</p><p>In February 1909, only a year after their conversion, the pair began meetings in an empty storeroom at 12th and Lafayette Streets in downtown Indianapolis. A few months later, services were moved to a tent at West 13th and the Canal.</p><p>Consistently bad weather made the location less than optimal, and a small frame building at 12th and Missouri Streets was secured. Elder Haywood felt led to hold a convention for area Pentecostals, but there was certainly not enough room in their present building. The Peniel Mission at 11th and Senate was rented for the occasion. Many were filled with the Holy Ghost in these meetings, and the church continued to rent the space, which was finally purchased by the growing congregation in 1919. In the early days of Pentecostalism, churches were not generally named. Pentecostals were determined not to lapse into the formalism of the denominations from which they had emerged, and churches were customarily known only by their location. This was the case with 11th and Senate.</p><p>In early spring 1916, Brother Glenn Cook, an elder from the Azusa Street Mission who had accepted baptism in the Name of Jesus arrived in Indiana, and was received by Bishop Haywood and his congregation at 11th and Senate.</p><p>March 6, 1916, Bishop Haywood and 465 members of his church were baptized in Jesus’ Name in Eagle Creek, marking the first apostolic baptisms east of the Mississippi River. J. Roswell Flower, the General Secretary of the Assemblies of God and a prolific opponent of the Oneness movement, sent a telegram to Bishop Haywood warning him of Brother Cook’s ''error.'' The message arrived too late, and Bishop Haywood, fully convinced of the veracity of Cook’s message, became one of the most avid and effective proponents and propagators of Oneness theology.</p><p>In 1910, Bishop Haywood’s church began publishing ''The Voice in the Wilderness''. After 1916, this became one of the most influential Oneness circulars, and was the official organ of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW), which followed Bishop Haywood into the Oneness movement. The PAW was formed in 1906, and he became the first presiding bishop of the organization, when it converted to the episcopal polity in 1925. He served in that capacity until his untimely death in 1931.</p><p>In 1924, construction was completed on Christ Temple, the final edifice undertaken by Bishop Haywood. This church, located on Fall Creek Boulevard, still stands.</p><p>After his death in 1931, he was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery, and in 1980, the city of Indianapolis renamed the segment of Fall Creek Drive where Christ Temple is located Bishop Garfield T. Haywood Memorial Way.",

Carrell, the first child of Paul and Pansy Carrell.</p><p>He worked in his family’s construction company and Patricia attended college at Indiana University and worked in retail. Patricia had agreed to marry David on one condition; that he would never become a preacher. Little did they know that God had other plans in store for their lives. Growing up in a Methodist church, David had little experience with Pentecost. This soon changed as Patricia’s mother, ''Grandma'' Carrell started inviting him to come to church with her.</p><p>Nearly two years after their marriage, David felt called of the Lord to start preaching in their home church, The United Pentecostal Assembly, informally known as the ''church on the highway'', which consisted mostly of members of the Carrell family. That same year, their son Ricky David was born. The Robinsons decided to build a new church building in Bloomington.</p><p>During this time Brother Robinson was the Youth President of Indiana. After pastoring there for nearly ten years, the Robinsons moved to pastor Christ Temple in Huntington, West Virginia. In 1960, while in West Virginia, Brother Robinson was the Home Missions Director, a Presbyter and the District Secretary. While in West Virginia, their daughter, Angelene Gayle, was born. In 1963, they built a new church building.</p><p>The Robinsons moved to Turlock, California, to pastor Full Gospel Tabernacle in 1965, and a little over a year later moved to pastor a United Pentecostal Church in Shreveport, Louisiana.</p><p>In 1967, the Robinsons went back to California, to begin evangelizing. During their four years of evangelism, they traveled across the entire country, bringing their small daughter with them. In the fall of 1972, Brother Robinson was directed of the Lord to go to Buffalo, New York, to build and grow another church, which would eventually become the congregation of New Life Center.</p><p>On December 17, 1972, the Robinson’s held their first service with a group of thirty people at Columbia Hook and Ladder Fire Club at 85 Marion St., North Tonawanda. After only a few weeks, they moved their services to a building affectionately known as ''the little brown church'', a former Free Methodist Church, at 89 Adams Street.</p><p>On July 1, 1975, after outgrowing the present building, the congregation moved to Buffalo, and shared the Redeemer Lutheran Church. The next year they moved to share the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church on a month to month basis.</p><p>Brother Robinson served as New York District Secretary and then held the position of New York District Superintendent for thirty-five years. While in office, he helped oversee the formation of the New York Metro District. He was also the Executive Presbyter of the Eastern Zone for three years. He is now the Honorary District Superintendent of the New York District.</p><p>Brother and Sister Robinson prayed,  worked,  witnessed,  gave of themselves,  resisted opportunities to quit,  kept on giving, and remain visionary for the founding and growing of a truly apostolic church!",

        "biography": "<p>Reverend Andrew D. Urshan was born on May 17, 1884, in Persia, in a village called Adabjaloo. This village lay approximately four hundred miles northwest of Mt. Ararat, where Noah’s ark rested. Andrew was converted in his homeland in 1900. In 1902, he came to the United States, landing in Yonkers, New York. He began preaching the gospel in 1904, and remained faithful to his calling until his death sixty-three years later.</p><p>In 1906, in Chicago, he witnessed a new touch of God’s sanctifying grace and a fresh divine anointing that set him on fire to win lost souls. He immediately began personal work among his fellow Assyrian people, with marked success. Two years later, in 1908, the Holy Ghost baptism fell upon converts in an unexpected manner in the upper room in Moody Bible Institute. This led him to seek the Lord again with a new determination to receive this heavenly outpouring of God’s spirit. On July 4, 1908, the Lord baptized him with the Holy Ghost and he spoke with tongues for several hours. The Lord opened the door for Brother Urshan to not only preach in the United States, but also in the British isles, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and Persia (now Iran).</p><p>During his lifetime, he wrote and polished at least eight books that were widely distributed. He was ordained in 1910, in Chicago, by William Durham. In 1917, Andrew Urshan was united in marriage with Mildred Harriet Hammergren. They were blessed with four children: Grace, Faith, Nathaniel, and Andrew II, who died in 1951.</p><p>It was in 1917, that he began publication of a monthly periodical ''There is Sunshine in the Shadows.''</p><p>On November 29, 1932, he affiliated with Pentecostal Assemblies of the Lord Jesus Christ and served as a presbyter in the eastern states. During his many years as a minister, he effectively evangelized throughout the nation and the world. Thousands were won to the Jesus Name message through his fervent, earnest, prayerful ministry. In 1933, he became pastor of the Satisfaction Gospel Mission (later the Apostolic Faith Christian Church) in New York City. He resigned this pastorate in 1950, and spent the remainder of his life speaking in special meetings, evangelistic services, and conferences.</p><p>In the early 1950s, Brother Urshan married Ethel May Dugas, who was his companion until her death. It was also in the early 1950s, that he moved to Long Beach, California, which was his home until his death. He preached his last sermon on October 12, 1967, in Bay City, Texas, in Pastor R. E. Johnson’s assembly.</p><p>The inspiring and effective ministry of Andrew D. Urshan, the ''Persian Evangelist'', made a lasting contribution to the present-day Oneness Pentecostal movement as we know it. He was a strong preacher of the Name of Jesus and a lover of the message of holiness unto the lord. Brother Urshan went to be with the lord on October 16, 1967, at the age of eighty-two.",

        "biography": "<p>Bennie Cole was born October 22, 1930, into a good Baptist family of three children, with an older sister and brother.  He was introduced to Pentecost at age fifteen by two neighborhood brothers: Baron and Kenneth Pope.  They both became members (together with a sister, Robbie, and a younger brother, Richard) of the church Bennie later founded in 1967 and continued to pastor until his retirement after forty-four years.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>On February 22, 1948, Bennie received the Holy Ghost lying flat on his back on top of the floor furnace at 967 South Pryor Street, Atlanta, Georgia, and felt a call to the ministry shortly thereafter.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>He married his pastor's daughter, Rachel Montgomery, on January 2, 1949, and volunteered to relieve his pastor, T.C. Montgomery, of the responsibilities of church janitor.  He also led the song and worship service.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Twenty-one months later, on November 23, 1950, a son, Benjamin Stephen Jr., was born to this couple. \r</p><p>In 1951 Bennie Cole and his wife resigned their jobs in Atlanta for him to enroll in the Pentecostal Bible Institute and for her to serve as the first secretary for the Tupelo Children's Mansion.  Another son, Phillip, was born to Bennie and Rachel on October 5, 1952, in Tupelo, Mississippi.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1954 at the age of twenty-four, he graduated from the Pentecostal Bible Institute, returned to Atlanta with his family, and assisted his brother-in-law, Pastor R. B. Montgomery, at First Pentecostal Church.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>At the Southeastern District conference in 1954, he was approved for local license and elected to serve as the youth director for the North Georgia section of that district.  In 1956 the district conference elected him to serve as youth president, and he remained on that committee for the next three years.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>On October 22, 1958, Bennie's present for his twenty-eighth birthday was a bundle of joy named Malinda Joy.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>On April 9, 1959, the Southeastern District conference convened in Ocala, Florida, and Bro. Bennie Cole was elected to serve as Conquerors president of the newly formed Georgia-South Carolina District. Camp meetings and conferences were held under a tent erected on a plot of donated land on Nowhere Road in Athens, GA.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1963 Bennie Cole was elected the new pastor of the United Pentecostal Church of Athens, Georgia, where he served for four years.  On October 23, 1963, a new member was added to the family.  Daniel Lee was born the day after his father's thirty-third birthday.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>At the close of their fourth year in Athens, Bennie Cole began to feel a deep burden for his home town of Atlanta: such a large city with so few churches.  They began to pray for God's perfect will in this matter.  He told his wife that he wanted to raise up a church that would give more to missions than it would cost to build the local church itself.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>On July 11, 1969, Bennie and Rachel had their fifth and final child, Jonathan Mark.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>At the district conference on September 8, 1977, Bennie Cole was appointed to fill the unexpired term of the secretary treasurer of the Georgia District. He remained in that office for ten years until 1987.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1979 he was elected to fill the unexpired term of the resigning Southern Regional Presbyter and served on the Executive Board of the UPCI.  He was reelected the following year for a two-year term.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1980 Apostolic Tabernacle moved to its current location.  At the District Conference of 1987, Bishop C. C. Wheatley stunned the conference with his resignation as district superintendent due to health problems. The conference elected B. S. Cole to the office and he continued to serve for eighteen years.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In addition to all the foregoing, Bennie Cole has served thirty-eight years on the board of directors of the Tupelo Children's Mansion to date, and seven years on the Board of Directors of New Beginnings to date.  Today he is retired from most of these duties, except to pray for the church, the district, the country, and the world for endtime revival to sweep this world and bring back the King.\r</p><p></p>",

John began preaching in the United Pentecostal Church (UPC) of Henderson, pastored by W.E. Fuller; soon after he received the Holy Ghost in 1961.  John Grant attended Texas Bible College in its first full year of operation.  \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Over a period of ten years, before Christmas for Christ existed, John founded and established three churches, the first in Cushing Texas.  While preaching revival services in Clintonville, Wisconsin, he felt God calling him to sell his newly built home in Texas and use the funds to start a church in Shawano, Wisconsin.  Following the leading of the Lord, he moved his wife and three sons, John Jr., Roy and Steve, to Shawano in 1968 where they purchased and filled a church building.  When the Wisconsin District expressed a need for a new work in LaCrosse, the Grants became the first Wisconsin Christmas for Christ (CFC) missionaries in yet another field of labor.   John resigned this work when their youngest son developed a rare kidney disease.  Soon after this, Calvary Gospel Church (CGC) desired him to come lead the congregation in Madison, Wisconsin.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Over the past forty-two years, Pastor Grant has seen this congregation grow into a multicultural body that currently holds six diverse services on Sunday, four midweek services, and fourteen outreaches which include jail ministries, campus and Hyphen services, and neighborhood churches. Calvary Gospel Church currently has four pastors on staff ministering to English, Spanish and international congregations. The church hosts a weekly Christian Intervention Program that has seen over five hundred participants filled with the Holy Ghost.  They operate a full-time child care center meeting the needs of the community.  Because of the work and influence of Calvary Gospel Church in the community, Pastor Grant was selected as the 'Pastor of the Year' for Dane County in 2011.  Pastor Grant currently serves as copastor with his son, Roy Grant. Over the last fifty-four years, Pastor Grant has worked side by side with his wife, teaching hundreds of Home Bible Studies.  His tenured ministry has awarded him the privilege of marrying couples, dedicating their children, marrying those children, and dedicating their children!  \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Over the years, Pastor Grant has suffered several major health problems including a heart attack, three cancer surgeries, and severe chronic back pain.  Through all of this, his faith in God has remained strong and his never-give-up spirit keeps him serving.  \r</p><p>\r</p><p>John Grant has served the Wisconsin UPC as a district Sunday school director, sectional presbyter, district superintendent for seventeen years, and has served two terms as an executive presbyter. He currently serves the United Pentecostal Church International an honorary General Board member.  He has traveled extensively preaching and teaching conferences, camp meetings, and seminars.  John is an advocate of unity and love.  He has taught ministerial ethics and Christian principles in a very easy to understand and unique way.  His life has promoted the Apostolic doctrine and holiness.\r</p><p></p>",

        "biography": "<p>Else Lund was born on September 16, 1932, in Dyment, Ontario, Canada. At the age of five, Else began her education in a one-room country school. Else graduated from high school in Dryden, Ontario, in 1950, and during the summer vacation she attended Teachers College in Toronto. Her goal was to obtain a degree in teaching and become a high school teacher. However, her life took a sudden turn when she contracted polio during the epidemic in 1953. Because of the epidemic, there was no room in the area hospitals, so Else was sent by train to a hospital in Sudbury.</p><p>Else was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to do anything for herself. After nine months she could walk again and somewhat care for herself. The medical field could do nothing more for her, so she was sent home. In the hospital Else had prayed the Lord's Prayer over and over. This was the only way she knew how to pray. Those with polio were all under quarantine. One day a pastor opened the door of her room and said, \"This is all for a purpose.\" She never forgot his words. How true they were! It was polio that brought the Lund family to the Lord.</p><p>In 1954 Else returned to teaching. At that time she was invited to a meeting in the Edward Kelbert home. This was the beginning of the United Pentecostal Church (UPC) in Dryden. In 1955 at the Kenora UPC, pastored by William Cooling, she repented. Later Brother Cooling baptized her in the name of Jesus Christ at Bethel Tabernacle in Winnipeg.</p><p>Realizing the Lord was leading her in another direction, she attended Apostolic Bible Institute and graduated in 1962. In October 1962, she received missionary appointment to Fassama, Liberia, West Africa.</p><p>In March 1963 Else sailed from Brooklyn, New York, on the African Glen, a commercial ship. The only other passenger on the three-week journey was a lady missionary returning to Liberia. She was older and gave Else much advice on missionary work, which later proved most helpful. Else believed the Lord arranged their meeting.</p><p>Else faced many challenges in Liberia, but the Lord took her victoriously through them all. Twice she faced danger when flying on the Sheaves for Christ Piper Cub. Once they were lost in fog over the jungle, and another time the brake cable unraveled as they landed, causing the plane to crash. Shortly after a coup, she almost lost her new Sheaves for Christ car. As a soldier stood with his gun in his hand, a slender, short plain-clothes man in travel attire stepped up, took her identification card out of the soldier's hand, handed it to her and said, \"This is all she requires.\" His words were so quiet and gentle that she actually relaxed. After he repeated the same words at least three times, Else realized she was free to go. On this man's approach, the tall soldier had clicked his heels and stood at frozen attention. Later they searched to learn who this man was. Nobody knew. She felt God had sent an angel to deliver her that day.</p><p>In February 1971 Else transferred to Accra, Ghana, to teach in the Bible school Missionary R. K. Rodenbush had opened. In 1989 Else returned to Liberia to work in the Bible school while the Jim Hall family was on deputation. In May 1990 she had to evacuate due to the civil war. Back in Ghana, she plunged into refugee work and helped build a church in the refugee camp. One of her Bible school students from Liberia, a refugee himself, pastored the work.</p><p>In 1998 Else was appointed to International Teaching Ministries and taught in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Togo, and Scotland. She also spent six months helping start a church in Copenhagen, Denmark. In November 2004 after forty-two years of service, she felt it the Lord's will to retire from Global Missions. She now resides in her hometown of Dryden.</p><p>In summing up her missionary years, Else stated, \"If I had the opportunity I would do the same thing again.\"</p>",

        "biography": "<p>David Lamar Welch was born in Kendricks Ferry, Louisiana, on May 21, 1905. Kendricks Ferry was never the same after a revival came to town, and the ever inquisitive D. L. went to see what it was all about. His mom told him, 'Now don't you get in that church!' He told her not to worry: \"That's the hardest church to get into.\" A strange thing happened to D. L. He started feeling sorry about all the wrong things he had done, and he felt the presence of God pleading with him to seek Him. He found his way to the old altar, and God filled him with His Spirit. He shouted, danced, and talked in tongues all the way home. When he got there, his mother asked, \"Did anyone get that Holy Ghost tonight?\" It hit him again and he began to shout and spin around and kick over the table and chairs. It wasn't long before he had the house all to himself. His family was not happy about his new-found religion.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>D.L. met Lottie Holloway and they tied the knot on March 18, 1924. Soon they were blessed with a beautiful baby girl, Sarah Margaret, on February 16, 1925. A short time after Sarah's birth, David Lamar Welch received a most important call: the call to preach. The young couple set out with their baby girl to their first revival in Mississippi. They stayed two weeks, went home, got rid of their farm and furniture, and they returned for another revival. He traded around and got himself an old World War I army ambulance, and struck out on the road evangelizing. It was off to Pearl River, Lousiana, and back to Mississippi to the town of Carriere, where about forty people received the Holy Ghost. From there they went to Poplarville, Mississippi, where they held a five-month revival; approximately one hundred received the Holy Ghost. While they were in Poplarville, their first son, David, was born November 25, 1927. Now the four Welches hit the road for Texas, but tragedy was at the end of that road. Their sweet little Sarah took sick and died at the age of three. Oh, the grief  and emptiness this young couple must have suffered! The young father prayed, \"Why, God? Why did she have to die?\" God's reply was, \"Can't you trust her in my keeping?\" D.L. said, \"Yes, Lord. I don't understand, but I will trust.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>His travel took him to Philadelphia, Mississippi, where their second son, Paul, was born, March 21, 1930. Next D. L. Welch felt led to go to Alabama where he built a church. It was here another son, Daniel, was born October 9, 1932. Finally, in 1933 D. L. Welch boarded a train to Pensacola, Florida, to preach another revival. In 1939 the Welches went back to Leesville, Louisiana, and preached for awhile. During this time another baby boy, Jimmy, was born. They had traveled and preached from Louisiana to California, from Maine to Miami, and all in between, with five children in tow and only faith in God to see them through. They returned to Pensacola, Florida, in 1939 and they never left again. Pensacola had their preacher man.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>With D. L. Welch's leadership, the church had phenomenal growth. The church expanded several times. A new auditorium was built next door to the existing church on Pace Boulevard, and property at a different location on W Street was purchased, but the building was not completed before his death. In 1975 D. L. Welch's son, Paul Welch, who had been assisting him as associate pastor, became pastor, and D. L. remained as senior pastor.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>D. L. Welch served as district superintendent of the Florida District, member of the district board, member of the General Board, and honorary General Board member. He served as chaplain of the Florida senate under the administration of Governor Fuller Warren. He was honored by Escambia County Commission as being a role model exemplifying the finest values. He received honor from Congressman Earl Hutto which was included in the congressional records. He received honor by having a portion of Marcus Pointe Boulevard dedicated to him; this is the location of the present church. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>The Reverend David Lamar Welch died September 7, 1994, in Pensacola, Florida. The people of Pensacola were blessed that he came to their town. \"And that's not nearly right; that is right\" (a favorite saying of D. L. Welch).\r</p><p></p>",

        "biography": "<p>J. R. Blackshear was born in a sharecropper's cabin on the Judd Hill Plantation near Trumann, Arkansas, on August 6, 1937.  His parents were Robert and Lottie Blackshear. He has only one sibling, a younger sister, Patricia, living and serving the Lord, along with her husband, Don, near Rector, Arkansas. His mother and father were very active members of their local church. His spiritual roots go back to his grandparents, the C. E. Talleys, who received the Holy Ghost and were baptized in Jesus' name in the 1940s. He married his cute, little, blond nurse, Betty Smith, on June 10, 1961, and is the very thankful father of two beautiful daughters, Alice and Barbara, and his son Jim, who has successfully succeeded him as pastor in Anchorage. He is the proud grandfather of seven grandchildren, all of whom, he is happy to say, have been baptized in Jesus' name.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>J. R. Blackshear has been an active licensed minister of the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) since May 1961. He began his ministry in May 1960 while still serving in the US army at Fort Richardson, Alaska, and attending the First United Pentecostal Church in Anchorage, Alaska, pastored by Agnes Rich. Agnes Rich was very helpful to him as he recognized the call of God to preach the gospel and expressed his desire to enter the ministry. She became his mentor and opened her pulpit to him, allowing him to begin his public ministry. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>J. R. Blackshear has served the UPCI in several capacities, as an evangelist for a short time, a Home Missions pastor in Kodiak, Alaska, as well as pastor of the United Pentecostal Church in Fairbanks, Alaska. He pastored for nearly five years in the Wisconsin District, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He and his family returned to Anchorage, Alaska in 1972 to pastor the First United Pentecostal Church of Anchorage. He was led of the Lord to organize the few Home Missions churches in Alaska into an official district of the UPCI and served a total of thirty-five years as overseer and district superintendent -- three years by General Board appointment and thirty-two years by election. He currently serves as an honorary member of the Alaska-Yukon District board, as well as an honorary General Board member. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Being encouraged by pilot and fellow UPCI preacher, Bill Crumpacker, J. R. Blackshear took it upon himself to become a pilot. He then became a licensed and certified flight instructor for the main purpose of training others to fly in order to provide a mode of transportation for gospel workers to reach the rural villages of the extremely large geographical area. He has taught many aspiring gospel workers to fly, as well as flying literally thousands of hours across the rural areas of the Alaska-Yukon District and into the many villages that have the need for a truth-preaching church. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>J. R. Blackshear has told it far and wide that the UPCI is by far the very best Oneness ministerial organization there is. He would like to thank the UPCI family for allowing him to serve these many years. He prays that the blessings of the Lord continue to flow through us until He comes for His bride.\r</p><p>",

He felt another call, however, to respond to the gospel of Christ. He received the Holy Spirit and was baptized in a church his father pastored in Wichita Falls, Texas.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>He soon felt another call.  This time to more active service as a minister. He and his wife, Irma Joy, started a new church in Electra, Texas. His speaking talents and writing abilities were quickly tapped, and he was asked to edit the Texas District publication, the Texas Sentinel. He also assumed the pastorate of a church in La Marque, Texas, where he served for many years. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>With Texas Bible College (TBC) experiencing burgeoning growth in Houston, not far from La Marque, he was conscripted to teach classes there. In the summer of 1969, as a result of his administrative abilities, he was asked to serve as president of Pentecostal Bible Institute in Tupelo, Mississippi, where he served for two school terms. During the summer of 1970, he returned to Texas to serve as president of TBC where he served for six years.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1977 he was elected as superintendent of the Texas District of the United Pentecostal Church International. He faithfully fulfilled the duties of this office for eighteen years, retiring in 1995. He passed from this life just a few days after retiring.  He is remembered for his broad Bible knowledge, quick wit, communication skills, and administrative expertise.\r</p><p>",

        "biography": "<p>One of the United Pentecostal Church's revered evangelists, Willie Johnson, was born May 2, 1905, in Roanoke, Virginia. She was the daughter of Louella Cougar and United States Senator Daniel Layne. She was 'sold' by her mother in marriage to Scott Johnson who severely physically abused her throughout the imposed marriage. When they moved to Wheeling, West Virginia, Sister Willie had decided that suicide was a successful way out of the relationship and she made her way to the Wheeling Bridge that spanned the Ohio River. As she approached the bridge, she heard spirited singing as she passed a small storefront Pentecostal church. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>She related in a message during an annual revival service at the Open Door Church, \"It was beautiful! I reasoned that it would not hurt, nor change anything if I pause and listen. I stood for a moment, and the singing drew me inside. Something got ahold of my heart, and the first thing I knew I was in the altar. I received the Holy Ghost, and it changed my life, it changed my future, it changed my eternity.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Willie was baptized in Jesus' name in 1933 by Bessie Seal of Wheeling, West Virginia. Over time she became a member of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World and was ordained in that organization. Her ministry expanded to several of our Bible colleges, including Christian Life College of Stockton and Apostolic Bible Institute of St. Paul where all enjoyed her ministry and song. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>She was encouraged by the pastors to affiliate with the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI), and she did so. She then evangelized from coast to coast for over fifty years and was awarded a certificate for outstanding service and honorary membership in the UPCI.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Daniel Scott testified: \"Of all the churches that have enjoyed Sister Willie Johnson's ministry, I feel that I can say without doubt that the Open Door Church in Charleston was her first love.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The West Virginia News published an article about her funeral which stated that \"funeral services were held in the Open Door Apostolic church in Charleston, West Virginia, where she had been a member for many years. Special singing and music were presented by Brother and Sister Hugh Rose and Sister Helen Claytor. William Cole gave tribute and read some of the telegrams received. Among them was one from General Superintendent Nathaniel A. Urshan. It read in part, \"Willie Johnson: saint of God, preacher deluxe, singer extraordinary. God's chosen has fought the fight, kept the faith, and gained the crown.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>A chapter devoted to Willie Johnson in Pioneer Pentecostal Women comments that she gave everything: spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and financially. She wore herself out in revival; she emptied herself out. She gave of herself untiringly! Her cross was not around her neck, but a special cross was on her back. James Kilgore preached that she was an example in attitude, in suffering, in simplicity, in motherhood, as a minister, prophetess, and more. And oh, she knew the power of a song and never lost her power to sing! \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Surviving are three children: Rudolph Johnson of Charleston, West Virginia; Scottie Johnson of Phoenix, Arizona; and Gloria Johnson of San Jose, California. She is also survived by one sister, Anna Mae Reynolds of Roanoke, Virginia; seven grandchildren; and six great grandchildren. Her husband Scott Johnson and one son, Donald, preceded her in death.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The West Virginia District has always been thrilled to call Willie Johnson one of their pioneers.\r</p><p>",

        "biography": "<p>From the early age of thirteen, Robert desired to be a preacher. Evangeline, who was raise in the home of a United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) pastor, always wanted to be a preacher's wife. It seemed ordained of God that they met while he was attending Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, where her father, Roy Simkins, was pastor. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1960 at age nineteen, and still in college, Robert hitchhiked thirty-five miles many weekends to open a church in Cutler, Illinois, which had been closed for years. In 1962 Robert and Evangeline were married. Together they labored to see the church grow into a thriving congregation with a record attendance of three hundred fifty on Easter 1968. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>In 1968 the Rodenbushes were appointed as the first resident missionaries to Ghana, West Africa, and continued to serve fulltime in Global Missions for forty-two years. During their years in West Africa, they led the opening of five nations: Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Benin, and Ivory Coast. The Ghana College of Bible was established in 1970, training more than one hundred students that became the church planters, pastors, evangelists, and soul winners that sparked unprecedented revival in West Africa. Thousands were baptized, and two hundred fifty churches and preaching points were opened. A Bible correspondence course was launched with over two thousand participants.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>From 1979 to 1990 Brother Rodenbush served as the coordinator of overseas ministries for Global Missions, and assisted in the development of several innovative concepts. He launched the Associates in Missions (AIM) program, writing the policy and sending out six hundred AIMers. He encouraged the increase of training centers worldwide, from twenty-four to eighty-four. He was the first coordinator of Compassion Services, and wrote policy and procedures for the missionary field fellowship concept and missionary job descriptions. He was involved in the development of the foreign Bible school student support program, and the formation of world conferences, a global concept now called Global Council. Robert Rodenbush was also China outreach coordinator in the 1980s, traveling fourteen times to China to encourage believers and take in Bibles and literature. He was involved in the first radio broadcast in mainland China. Additionally, the Rodenbushes coordinated the annual School of Missions for twelve years and traveled extensively preaching and promoting missions.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>From 1991 to 2010 Robert Rodenbush served as regional director of the seventy-six nations in the Europe and Middle East region. For twenty years the Rodenbushes encouraged and inspired revival and unprecedented growth. Working closely with dedicated missionaries and national ministers, they saw forty-two nations opened in the region for the UPCI. This means that forty-two nations now have a church or believers, which before had none of which we were aware. The constituency grew from seven thousand to thirty-five thousand, and the number of missionaries and AIMers more than doubled. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>The Rodenbushes now live in Indianapolis, Indiana, near their son, Rob; daughter-in-law, Jaye; and grandchildren, Micki Evangeline and Robert Mooney. Robert Rodenbush served thirty-two years on the Global Missions administrative committee, thirty-seven years on the Global Missions board, and twenty years as a member of the General Board. He has been a licensed minister for fifty-five years. He presently serves as dean of International Studies and Missions at Indiana Bible College, training and mentoring the next generation of preachers and missionaries.\r</p><p></p>",

        "biography": "<p>On May 6, 1917, David Franklin Gray was born to missionary parents Frank and May Gray while they were living and ministering in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. His older sister Olive had also been born in Japan just fifteen months prior. When the Frank Grays returned to the states in 1919 for medical reasons, they settled in Los Angeles, California, where a third child, Paul, was born.</p><p>As a young boy, Brother Gray was filled with the Spirit of God and became an ardent student of the Word and a powerful defender of truth. When he was twelve, the family moved to Baldwin Park and began attending Brother George Farrell's church. Because the high schools in Baldwin Park at the time were considered so bad, the Grays found a Christian school in Watsonville, California, for David and his sister, Olive, to attend.</p><p>After attending Monte Vista Christian School at Watsonville, he spent time in Bible training in Stockton, California, and later went on to Harry Morse's Pentecostal Training School in Oakland, California. It was while he was attending the Pentecostal Training School that he met and married Emily Belle Butler on November 22, 1936.</p><p>During his years of ministry, he evangelized and pastored churches in Pasadena, Oakland, Turlock, and San Diego, California. His longest pastorate was Revival Tabernacle, which he, along with his wife Emily and daughter Naomi, established in February 1945. They started in a storefront on Seventh Street in downtown San Diego. After moving to several other locations during the next eighteen years, they built a beautiful edifice, patterned after the tabernacle in the wilderness, on six acres rightly referred to as Pentecostal Park. The church, now called the Anchor Church, still exists and thrives at this location. While they were early in their pastorate at Revival Tabernacle, their family increased with the birth of a son, David Samuel, and a short time later, their youngest daughter, Deborah Sharon. Being a man of great and unselfish vision, he helped Revival Tabernacle to mother churches in National City, Chula Vista, El Cahon, Linda Vista, Palm City, Tijuana, San Diego (downtown), as well as three other churches which merged with other existing congregations.</p><p>He passed from this life on August 23, 1996, and his voice will be greatly missed among those of us in the Apostolic ranks.</p>",

He left the family in poverty, and she was raise in the slums under very difficult circumstances. She seemed doomed to despair and bitterness, but an Apostolic preacher brought a tent revival to her hometown.

She was ordained September 18, 1942, in Muncie, Indiana as a member of the Pentecostal Church Incorporated (PCI). As a single woman evangelist, she was a phenomenon in the era shortly after women's suffrage. She preached revivals for iconic pioneer Apostolic pastors, including Brothers Branding and Greer. She actually won her future husband’s heart as an evangelist in Vandalia, Illinois. She married Norman Paslay on October 29, 1942, and was the mother of one son, Norman Paslay II. Mary Alice Paslay voted at the merger in 1945, with her ordination being reissued January 1, 1946. She was a charter member of the United Pentecostal Church (UPCI).</p><p>Norman Paslay grew up on a farm in Illinois, and learned hard work as a way of life.  In February 1937, he attended a Pentecostal revival to help his best friend win a Bible. He experienced Pentecost and was baptized in Jesus’ name; they cut a hole in the ice of a frozen pond to facilitate this incredible event. He was the first in his family to experience the new birth, and as a teenager he won his parents and siblings to the Lord. Immediately, he acknowledged a call to ministry and started preaching in 1937, at the age of sixteen.</p><p>He was ordained July 2, 1942, in Illinois, and was a member of the PCI. He was a driver for Howard Goss, taking him to various meetings and forums on a merger-endorsing campaign to rally support from the churches in the PCI. He voted at the merger, and his ordination certificate was reissued on January 1, 1946. He and his wife were the only married couple to both vote at the merger in 1945.</p><p>Mary Alice and Norman Paslay were a unique tandem in evangelistic work 1942–1956, preaching every other night. She had a strong and unique pulpit presence, using a dramatic, dynamic style that included a clear presentation of the gospel. It was the opinion of her husband that \"she was a much better preacher than I was.\" Her flamboyance was a definitive element of her unique style. While having an established ministry in her own right, she deferred to a role of support when they began their pastoral ministry.</p><p>Children's ministry was a defining dynamic of Mary Alice's ministry. She was among the very first to feature services for children, with songs and outreach targeting up to age ten, and pioneered the vision of having a specific evangelistic forum that became children's church. She was active in writing feature articles for the children's page which was incorporated into the Pentecostal Herald, the earliest articles dating to 1947.</p><p>Music, both singing and recording, was a part of their collective impact on the UPCI. As part of the first recording efforts of the Oneness Movement, they recorded 78s starting in the 1940s. Their theme song of \"Happy People\" was a significant blessing in a time when war was dominating life. The classic song \"Pentecostal Music\" was literally the Book of Acts set to music. It impacted thousands and saw services overwhelmed with worship as the Holy Ghost was being poured out. They traveled as full-time evangelists for fourteen years, having a full schedule while never making a call about availability.</p><p>They settled in Cincinnati in 1956, pouring themselves into pastoral ministry until 1992.

In July 1968, they received a call from God to move to North Dakota and build churches. Within four days after arriving in North Dakota on December, he secured a job and made arrangements to buy a church building complete with hymnals and a piano. It also had an apartment with furniture. They moved in January 1969. In February, Brother Pugh informed them that they would receive Christmas for Christ funds for one year. During the next year, he knocked on every door of Bismarck, North Dakota.</p><p>He also helped establish the “Great Plains Development” during the first year, a region including North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.

        "biography": "<p>Charles Garland Weeks was born March 18, 1908, in the Walnut Hill community of Louisiana’s Vernon Parish.  He was one of four children born to Charles H. Weeks and Samantha Olevia Boyd Weeks.  After graduating from Slagle High School, he attended Northwestern State University. Edna Marie Farrow was the great love of his life, his best friend, and partner for life. They were married on March 20, 1930.</p><p>The year 1930 was an eventful one for the newlyweds. Brother Weeks’s mother was ill, and the young couple moved to Walnut Hill to assist in her care. While there, their neighbors, David and Ida Whisby, invited the young couple to join them at a brush arbor tent revival being held nearby. It was to be a life-changing event, for it was in that first service that Marie received the Holy Ghost. A few months later, on the back porch of the Whisby home, Garland Weeks received the Holy Ghost as well.</p><p>Shortly after receiving the Holy Ghost, it became clear to C. G. Weeks that the call of the Lord was upon his life, and he stepped out to pursue ministry. He soon became a much-in-demand evangelist. They traveled miles and miles by bus and train, often with limited funds, committed to the calling neither could deny.</p><p>By the early 1940s, Bloomington, Indiana, had become home. The Weeks had settled down to a pastorate. Having lost a stillborn daughter in the fall of 1933, in the summer of 1941, they joyously welcomed Wanda Marie, a second daughter, into their world. Then a call came from a group in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, wanting a pastor. From 1943 to 1953, the First Pentecostal Church of Baton Rouge flourished under the leadership of Pastor C. G. Weeks.</p><p>In 1953, with the retirement of S. L. Wise as Louisiana’s district superintendent, C. G. Weeks was elected to that position. He led the Louisiana District in repeated achievements of placing first in offerings to Sheaves for Christ, Mothers Memorial, Christmas for Christ, and others. In addition, he served on the board of Tupelo Children’s Mansion (TCM).</p><p>Camp Meeting 1978 found C. G. Weeks, at the age of seventy, somewhat weakened and utilizing a cane to steady his gait, but exuberant in his love of camp meeting and love of worship. Friday night he grabbed his familiar rubboard and spoon and stepped to the podium with Sister Shirley Rimes to join her in singing “Someday I’ll Walk on Gold.” When the song ended, turning around he made his way to the office.  Once there, an ambulance was called and he was transported to a local hospital where he was diagnosed to be in cardiac arrest.  Brother Weeks passed from this life on Saturday, July 8, 1978.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Ted Wagner was born in Orillia, Ontario, Canada on July 4, 1943, the first of four children born to Carl and Theresa Wagner.  He attended public school in Weston, Ontario, and then the University of Western Ontario in London.  In 1967, he married Margaret Wagstaff. Their son, Jeff, was born in Ontario, and soon afterwards they moved to British Colombia.</p><p>A year later, their love of the outdoors took them to the Yukon Territory, where their daughter, Jennifer, was born. Ted Wagner became a big game hunting guide, and thought they were following their own plans and desires. Six years after making the Yukon their home they came to know Jesus Christ as their Savior.  A fifteen-year-old girl, Jennifer Mack, witnessed to Brother Wagner about Apostolic truth, and he was baptized in Jesus' name in February 1977, by Robert Langston. He received the baptism of the Holy Ghost on July 3, of the same year.</p><p>In 1972, Brother Wagner found himself thrust into leading the First Pentecostal Church in Whitehorse through a very difficult time. There were only seventeen people in the church, and the church had a $254,000 debt.  Eight and a half years later the quarter million dollar debt of the church was gone. And eight and a half years after that, the congregation built a brand new twelve thousand square foot church facility, debt free. Throughout this time, the First Pentecostal Church of Whitehorse was on the leading edge of sacrificial giving to all ministries of the United Pentecostal Church.</p><p>Brother Wagner has served on the Alaska-Yukon District Board for twenty-seven years. In 1995, he was elected Executive Presbyter for Canada, a position he served in for eight consecutive years. He served twelve years on the UPCI Executive Board, as Presbyter for Canada from 1995-2001, and as Presbyter for the Northwest Region in 2004-2005 and 2010-2011.  He was one of the founding board members of Urshan Graduate School of Theology, and served there for twelve years.  He has served on the Home Missions Advisory Committee and the North American Advisory Committee since 2001, and is currently an honorary member of the General Board.</p><p>In 2010 Brother Wagner retired as pastor of First Pentecostal Church in Whitehorse. The Wagners continue to attend there under the able leadership of Pastor Roger Yadon.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>E. L. and Nona met January 25, 1937. Love came instantly, though both were in denial about a call to preach and a call to Africa, so that they did not mention it to each other. God called Brother Freeman before his seventh birthday and Sister Freeman at age eleven with the infilling of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>\t</p><p>I collapsed at college in March that year and was sent home from the hospital with thirty-six hours to live. Death came, but during those thirty minutes of time when my heart did not beat and I did not breathe, I met Jesus face to face. I confessed my disobedience and failures and promised to do His will if He would allow me to come back. He graciously forgave me and sent me back. My life turned around at twenty. Because of Bugs apparent lack of spirituality, I immediately broke our engagement, but Jesus has His own beautiful and exquisite ways of working out His will in human lives.</p><p>God later let me know that our marriage agreed with His will, so we were married in August, still keeping our secrets. God said I must be still and let Him guide us. Bugs ambition lay in the business world where he had wonderful opportunities, though he had long sought earnestly for the Holy Ghost. When he decided to surrender to God’s will and preach, the Spirit came on him wonderfully and he talked in tongues for three days. His preaching (and mine) began in a revival in New Mexico, April 1939. In that revival, Jesus told on us about Africa, and from that hour, our predominant thoughts concentrated on GOING.</p><p>Our deep desire to get to Africa moved us to drive from New Mexico to St. Louis, Missouri, in September 1939 (with great difficulties and without needed necessities) to meet the missionary board. They felt insulted (rightly so) that with only five months preaching experience, we would meet them wanting to be appointed to Africa. This was simple ignorance on our part. However, they gave us good advice: “Don’t trade on a missionary call; work for God—hold meetings, start a new work, go through every door God opens—and come back in three years.”</p><p>Without resentment, we took their advice and tried to meet the board again in 1941 and 1942, but they did not have time to see us. By this time, we were pastoring our second church in Louisiana. We asked if we could see them at the Conference in 1943. The meeting would begin at 1 p.m. and end about 6 p.m. If we were there and they had time, they would talk to us. We got to the appointed place at 12:30 p.m. When their meeting ended at 6:30 p.m., they marched out and said, “Sorry, we didn’t have time to talk to you this year; come back next year.”</p><p>My husband immediately began to encourage me to have the right attitude and not resent anything, promising that we when we returned home we would be able to settle everything by prayer. In that all night prayer meeting, God gave me a Scripture verse: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit” (John 15:16). As I read this to my husband, I started shouting. He had received the same verse and finished reading it: “…and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.”</p><p>At a Louisiana district conference in 1944, the missions director announced that we had a missions call. Our precious friend, George Glass Sr., said, “We love the Freemans and do not want them to leave us, but if they have a call to Africa, we need to send them. Bring your gifts to them and put it in the guitar case!”</p><p>Everyone began to weep and most of them made several trips to the case to add to that offering. The war raged then, and America still felt the steely grip of depression, but $3,400 resulted. Three weeks later we received a letter from the board appointing us to Africa, if I could pass a doctors examination on being able to go. When I was fifteen, a doctor had discovered that I had only one lung, but Jesus gave me a new one just in time, so I passed the test. In March 1948, that offering paid the Freemans' fare to Africa on a cargo boat with five children, ages ranging from nine years to six months. There were no planes to Africa then.</p><p>I’ve written books about our forty-one years of adventure in Africa which prove beyond a shadow of doubt that the incomparable grace of Jesus is sufficient for every situation. No matter how ugly or desperate the situation, He is forever able! One of the most amazing things Jesus did early in our journey was guiding Brother Freeman to visit other African countries by faith and claim them for Jesus. Within a short time of his unofficial visits when he walked over that country and claimed it, someone in America would get a burden for that land and GO! Then, speedily, revival’s flame would blaze from unexpected quarters. Speaking of revivals, we saw incredible miracles of healing and salvation in the twenty years of tent revivals that we held, often under very challenging conditions all over the country, a rich reward for the small sacrifices we made.</p><p>All the missionaries that went before us to Africa were sent to Liberia, a small country on the west coast known as the white man’s grave. E. L. Freeman refused to go there. He said, I am not afraid of the climate, but the rest of that vast continent needs the true gospel! He carried an immense burden for Africa, and, after twenty-three years in South Africa, the board handed him the whole continent except for the five countries at the top of it (they fall with the Middle East region.)</p><p>During the time T. F. Tenney served as the missions director, for two years he arranged for us to visit, encourage, and try to open other countries. We continued to do this for another eighteen years after Bug's appointment as regional field supervisor (now known as regional director). We had many more adventures in Jesus' name, trying to open up new areas for the preaching of this glorious gospel, and saw unusual success in that endeavor.</p><p>Somewhere along there, my dearest Bug had to go to St. Louis for a board meeting while I remained in Africa. Jesus visited me in a vision saying, the churches in America are in trouble, the affluence of America has robbed them of their trust in me, and they don’t even realize it. I’m cutting your missionary work short and sending you back to America. Accept every invitation you get to visit the churches and tell them what you have seen me do and what I can do for them.</p><p>When Bug came back, he excitedly told of having the same vision. Shortly after that the Board decided we were getting too old to be missionaries. We knew why! We came back to America in 1989 and together we did what He said for ten years. There were also some visits overseas. Then my darling got the call to go higher in 1999, but before he left me he told me what to do. Keep on doing what you are doing and be happy.</p><p>A near-fatal accident in Kenya, Africa, in 1973 taught us the beautiful message of praise and worship. It still sustains me at eighty-eight as my beautiful daughter, Sandra Freeman lives with me and helps me deliver my urgent message to the family of God; trust Jesus completely and walk in the liberty and power of the Holy Ghost!</p>",

        "biography": "<p>The Rolstons were both born in Ulster, Northern Ireland, in Protestant families.  In 1912 Sadie Rolston came to Canada. She belonged to the Salvation Army, and later received the Holy Ghost in a Trinitarian Pentecostal church. William J. Rolston lived in Ireland and went to France as a volunteer soldier in World War I. He returned to Ireland because he had been hit by shrapnel in his shoulder.  He came to Toronto in 1919 and worked as a manager of the Dominion Chain, Ltd. in various cities.  He drifted west and ended up in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he became severely ill and was hospitalized for fifty-one days.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Sadie Rolston had been visiting the hospitals for about six years as a volunteer worker. She witnessed to the patients, read the Bible to them, prayed with them, and wrote letters for them. She was becoming a bit weary of this work, and decided not to do it anymore. A friend of hers, Sister Hynes, told her of an Irish patient who had no one to visit him and asked Sadie to go to see him. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>William and Sadie met, and she told him about the Lord and left a Bible with him. William attended the Pentecostal church with her one night. In the meeting he became very ill, and the preacher was called to pray for him. When the preacher prayed, it was a like an electric shock going from the fingertips of both hands right through his body. He was healed instantly, and the illness never returned. In time he proposed, and they were married.  \r</p><p>\r</p><p>William Rolston began studying God's Word earnestly. One morning as he slipped out of bed and fell on his knees for a short time in prayer, the Lord met him there.  He could not speak a word of English. Finally, in English, the name Woodstock was spoken three times, and the word go three times. Shortly after they received a letter from the minister that had baptized them, and he told them the pastor had died in Woodstock, New Brunswick, and that the congregation there needed a pastor. The Rolstons sold their possessions, paid for their fare to Woodstock, New Brunswick, and went in Jesus' name. There was a wonderful revival in Woodstock.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>From Woodstock the Lord impressed them to go to Westfield, Maine. They had no money for the head tax, but one night just before they were to leave, a woman shook hands with Sadie and put a fifty-dollar bill in her hand. This was just the amount they needed. From Woodstock, they went to Tilley, New Brunswick.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>One man in Tilley said, \"I never have heard such preaching. Everyone should hear this man preach.\" So he arranged for the Rolstons to preach in the church there. It had been occupied by Baptists, but most of the former Baptists were now Jesus Name Pentecostals, as they had come in under the ministry of William Rolston. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Other pioneer works and cottage meetings were at Burnt Land Book, Rowena, Arthurette, and Davis Mills, each place planting this message in the hearts and lives of hungry souls. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>On July 27, 1931, the first convention was held at Plaster Rock. The Rolstons planned it to be the first year anniversary service, but the saints wanted it to last longer than one day. The original convention was housed in the tent and somehow the food stretched for all the folks that attended from near and far. For thirty-two years these conventions have continued. Each year fine men of God have come to teach and minister to the people. Most of them confirmed the excellent teaching Brother Rolston had previously given.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>William Rolston is the pastor at Plaster Rock, Tilley, and New Denmark. He is a presbyter of the Maritime District and is also serving on the Global Missions board of the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). Many have gone on to glory that never would have heard the message, perhaps, unless the Rolstons had followed the leadings of the Lord and come to this area.\r</p><p></p>",

        "biography": "<p>Charles Dean “Charlie” Mahaney was born June 25, 1942, in Wichita, Kansas, to Orville and Nadine Mahaney. He was the third of four children. Charlie’s family was poor and lived in crime-filled neighborhoods during his childhood. His father, a World War II veteran, became an alcoholic, and his mother worked as a taxi driver and hotel maid. She often spoke about Jesus and said “one day we will go to church and find Him again.”</p><p>At the age of eight, Charlie already had a severe addiction to alcohol. He spent most of his adolescent years on the streets, becoming involved in drugs, street gangs, sleeping in graveyards, and various crimes. He was arrested over forty times, and served time in the Sedgwick County Prison Farm.</p><p>After his mother died from cancer at age forty-four, his life began to spiral out of control. Evil spirits tormented his mind and controlled his life until one day in the early 1960s Pastor Denver L. Stanford knocked on his door and invited him to church. For the next three years, Pastor Stanford worked diligently with Charlie Mahaney.</p><p>In August 1963 Charlie met a young lady named Juanita Katheryn Rappe (Charlie nicknamed her “Lucky.”), who had started attending the local United Pentecostal Church. Charlie had met the love of his life! In October 1963 Juanita was baptized in Jesus’ name and filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Charlie and Juanita were married December 9, 1964. They were blessed with three children: Nichols Dean and twins Michelle Nadine and Michael Aaron.</p><p>In January 1966 Charlie completely surrendered his life to God, received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and was baptized in the precious name of Jesus. He had finally met the God his mother had told him about! Thirty days later he began to feel the call to preach!</p><p>In 1969 God led him to pastor his first church in Pittsburgh, Kansas. In 1972 he was ordained by the United Pentecostal Church International and felt the call to the evangelistic field. That year he preached his first revival in Lebanon, Missouri, for Pastor Bob Thorton. For the next thirty-four years, Charles Mahaney traveled across North America and around the world preaching revivals, tent meetings, city-wide crusades, camp meetings, and national conferences.</p><p>In 1980 he began preaching in jails and prisons. His burden for incarcerated people would lead to his 1982 appointment as the first UPCI National Coordinator for Prison Ministry, a position he held for twenty-seven years. Under his leadership and with the assistance of men like Albert Dillon, Bill Yanders, Joe Elles, Michael Rickenbaker, Don Grigsby and many others, Christian Prisoners Fellowship (CPF) was established. Since 1982 CPF has trained and certified more than 3,000 volunteers for ministry in correctional environments and reached thousands with the gospel. CPF has developed literature for inmates, created a network of regional and district chaplains, and organized an annual conference.</p><p>In 1979 Charlie made the first of more than thirty-five trips to Israel and the Holy Land, and awakened a passion for his Jewish roots and the Hebrew culture. David Gray of San Diego, California, encouraged him in his study of the Hebrew language. In his visits to Israel, he met Rabbi Chaim Richman,  Director of the Temple Institute; Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel; and Yasser Arafat, Palestinian political leader. He was the first non-Israeli Certified Tour Guide in Israel, and he also received the prestigious “Friends of Israel” award for his contribution to the nation of Israel. He was appointed the first UPCI National Coordinator of Jewish Ministries in 1998, and served in that position until 2005.</p><p>Today his legacy continues in the many books that he authored. He is survived by his wife, “Lucky,” and his children: Evangelist Nick Mahaney and wife Sandra, Pastor Michael A. Mahaney and wife Tamara, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p>",

He married Marian June Anderson, in August 1946 and his first daughter, Marcia, was born in 1947. He graduated with his Bachelor’s degree in History in 1948 and earned his Master’s degree in 1949. He also studied Greek, Hebrew, and ancient literature. He worked for twenty-five years in the Michigan Secretary of State’s office as an administrator in the investigation and driver's license division.</p><p>In June, 1951, he took over a prayer meeting from Gus Anderson in Albion, Michigan, and started Christ Apostolic Church with four people. He and Marian June built a thriving church that he pastored for 36 years until his death in 1987. He served as Youth President and sectional presbyter in the Michigan District, and became the Michigan District Superintendent at the age of thirty-three.</p><p>Under his leadership the Michigan District broke ground on a 120-acre campground in April 1966. Today the Michigan District’s William R. Starr Camp and Conference Center continues to fulfill his vision to see an Apostolic haven where people can be safe, saved, and renewed, while enjoying Christian fellowship.</p><p>He served as the executive presbyter of the eastern zone and chairman of the committee on judicial procedure. He also founded the Apostolic Institute of Development.</p><p>William R. Starr was known by the people who knew him best for his passion for people. He cared for the poor and fatherless, had a strong sense of justice, and stood up for those who he believed were treated unfairly. He was known to help anyone—no matter if they were a member of his congregation or not. He was well respected in his community and was a vocal advocate for civil rights and equality. He wrote columns in local newspapers and had a radio broadcast.</p><p>Bill and Marian June raised five girls that married five UPCI ministers: Martyn and Marcia Ballestero, Rick and Alexa Olson, David and Rebecca Trammell, Curtis and Priscilla Spears, and Tom and Sara Copple. At sixty-two years old, he passed away suddenly of a heart attack. He died with his boots on, still pastoring the church in Albion and leading Michigan District as superintendent.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>When Lee Stoneking was a small boy, his mother took him into the woods behind a log cabin home, lifted him in her arms to heaven, and prayed, “God, take this boy and make something out of his life.” She had been baptized in Jesus’ name in a Pentecostal revival in Knoxville, Iowa, and she taught Lee about Jesus and His ways.</p><p>Lee became involved in art, music, and dancing as a young man. When he was sixteen, his spinal column was damaged in a serious car accident. Although he continued to dance in major theaters in Des Moines, Iowa and other places, and was invited to audition at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, his dancing career was cut short due to his injuries. He also worked as an executive secretary and studied commercial art at Drake University in Des Moines. He was active in the Evangelical Free Church and was also involved in Youth For Christ and Campus Crusade.</p><p>A Oneness Apostolic cousin connected Lee with an Apostolic pastor in Des Moines, and, after initial resistance, he became convinced that the Apostolic teachings were biblical. In an Apostolic church with Brother Butcher, he witnessed prayer for healing and heard people testify that their pain had gone. Since Lee was going to the doctor every other day due to intense pain, he began to wonder if God would heal him as well. The next service he told Brother Butcher, “I want prayer for my body tonight.” Brother Butcher anointed him with oil and simply said, “In Jesus’ name be healed.”  Monday morning there was no pain, Tuesday no pain, Wednesday no pain, Thursday no pain. Friday the doctor’s office called. They said, “are you bedfast? You have missed all your appointments.”  Lee said, “I went to an Apostolic church and they prayed for me for healing and I have been healed! The doctor was furious and predicted that within one month Lee would be back “in worse shape than you have ever been in.” Lee smiled and said, “No I don’t think so, I think this is going to work.”  Today, more than fifty years later, it is still working!</p><p>Lee was baptized in Jesus’ name July 23, 1963, and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost October 6, 1963. He has held three pastorates, planted a church, evangelized all over the United States and around the world, and hosted twenty-two tours to Israel. He has seen thousands receive the Holy Ghost and thousands healed of all manner of diseases.</p><p>On November 12, 2003, Lee Stoneking fell instantly dead of a massive heart attack in the airport in Sydney, Australia.  He was clinically dead for forty-five minutes and was declared dead on arrival (DOA).  But after medical science had failed, Jesus stepped on board the ambulance. Lee recounts, “My heart began to beat; my breath came back. It startled the driver and the paramedic! They had never seen anything like it.  Blood had coagulated in my hands and forearms, feet and legs.”</p><p>Lee Stoneking addressed the United Nations General Assembly April 22, 2015, sharing the message of Acts 2:38. Within forty-eight hours of the address, over four million people worldwide had viewed and heard it.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>In the small community church in Crawford, Texas, a record book holds a simple notation: “One small boy received the Holy Ghost.” This boy, Marvin Dale Treece, had lost his father, a Baptist minister, when he was at only eighteen months old. The youngest of five siblings, Marvin possessed musical abilities which prompted an invitation to furnish music at a Pentecostal church service. While attending those services, he experienced the saving power of the Holy Ghost. Soon after that initial experience, Marvin began to feel his calling to the ministry. His mother and step-father would not accept his call for the kingdom, expelling him from home at twelve years of age.</p><p>The ensuing years were filled with lessons involving faith, love, and trust. His marriage to Betty Osborne founded a shared ministry of music, evangelism, and eventual pastorship. Early pastorates included Vivian and Monroe, Louisiana, but Marvin and Betty, along with their two young children, Paula and Ricky, found their permanent pastoral field in Lake Charles, Louisiana at the Apostolic Temple church. It was there that Marvin began a ministry marked by passion for God’s Word and compassionate dedication to his flock.</p><p>Marvin served as the Louisiana District Youth President (1962–1968), founded the Louisiana Bible Quizzing program (1966), and served as an Executive Presbyter on the UPCI General Board (1979–1981). Additionally, Brother Treece was a founding member of the Conqueror’s Quartet, organized to support the Louisiana District’s Sheaves for Christ fundraising initiative.</p><p>Marvin Treece’s ministry was characterized by an intense dedication to God’s Word. Early forays into the study and teaching of prophecy led to his realization of the benefits of reading Scripture in its original languages. In 1981 he began manuscript correspondence with the British Library. On June 30, 1983, Brother Treece earned his Doctorate of Theology and Divinity from the International Bible Institute and continued his studies at Cambridge, Oxford, and Trinity Universities in Europe. These studies resulted in the authorship of the “Literal Word” Bible commentaries, which include Acts 1, Acts 2, I Corinthians, Revelation, and Hebrews. The “Literal Word” is a testament to Brother Treece’s love of the Lord and His Word.</p><p>From 1989 to 2002, Brother Treece preached meetings and conferences across the United States. He was honored to preach at General Conference in 1976, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Marvin also endured the pain of a degenerative back condition for nearly thirty years, yet he found solace in continued prayer and study. Perhaps his greatest source of peace was the knowledge that his son had taken the pastorate of Apostolic Temple and continued the legacy of devotion to God’s Word and Truth.</p><p>At the end of his life shaped by prayer and the Word of God, it would only be fitting for his life’s last moments to be accentuated by both. Though pain and sickness had run its course, Brother Treece lifted his eyes to his Lord and Savior and uttered the eternal words, “Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come…” And so the man who had started his journey as “one small boy” receiving the Holy Ghost in Crawford, Texas, ended his journey as the preacher, pastor, scholar, loving father, and grandfather–walking into the Kingdom of God he had served for so long.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Ralph Vincent Reynolds began his ministry in 1936 by preaching in the schoolhouses, homes, and lumber camps of six communities during the closing years of the Great Depression. The Sunday before he went to sleep in the Lord, he concluded preaching a four-week revival just short of his eighty-ninth birthday. In that revival, fourteen received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It concluded his sixty-six years of Apostolic ministry.</p><p>Ralph Vincent Reynolds was born in Picton, Ontario, Canada. He graduated from Picton Collegiate Institute and then attended Peterborough Normal School. From thence he went into the teaching profession. For twelve and one-half years he taught science and mathematics in the provincial public schools of Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia, Canada. His desire was to become a civil engineer when God called him to the ministry. In 1936 he married his first wife, Helen Welsh, and for more than sixty years they had no permanent dwelling place. He was always on the move preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>As a young boy, Ralph would stand on a chair, wave his arms, and shout at the top of his voice. His answer to the question of what he was doing was, I am preaching! However, as a young man he declared strongly that there were two things he would never do: preach or teach. Since that time, Ralph V. Reynolds has spent sixty-two years preaching and teaching. His ministry has spanned six decades and touched two centuries.</p><p>His new-birth experience took place in February 1934, in The Old Brick Church in Picton. He held credentials with three church organizations: The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, The Apostolic Church, and the United Pentecostal Church International. After ministering for six years, he was first ordained in 1942 in Picton, Ontario with the Apostolic Pentecostal Church, and in 1946 his ordination was transferred to the United Pentecostal Church International.</p><p>Brother Ralph Reynolds served in many official capacities in the United Pentecostal Church International:</p><p>Served two years as northwest regional presbyter and Executive Board member.</p><p>Served twenty-four years as a member of the General Board.</p><p>Served eighteen years as an honorary member of the General Board.</p><p>Served as district superintendent of two North American districts and one missionary district.</p><p>Served on five different district boards.</p><p>Served one year on the Foreign Missions Board.</p><p>Served three years on the Board of Christian Education.</p><p>Served eight years as missionary under appointment to Jamaica.</p><p>Founded four Bible schools, including the first one on a foreign missionary field.</p><p>During his ministry, Brother Ralph V. Reynolds pastured eighteen churches. He planted a church in the beautiful city of Cranbrook, British Columbia, at the ripe old age of eighty-three. As soon as he raised the money and built the new sanctuary, he turned it over to a young man. He never lost the vision of opening one more church, literally up to the day he passed on to his reward.</p><p>For many years Ralph V. Reynolds was unsurpassed as a Oneness Pentecostal author. He wrote sixteen books, twenty-four units of the Alpha Bible Correspondence Course which are being used in many foreign Bible schools, and the Spirit of Freedom course for prisoners and the drug-dependent which is now being used widely in the court system. He was named Writer of the Year in 1985.</p><p>Eighty-six-year-old Ralph V. Reynolds was joined in marriage to Myrna Kelsey who was a faithful helpmeet and friend for the last two and one-half years to a great man with a failing body.</p><p>For the better part of a century a giant has walked among us. His sterling character, his strong but humble spirit, his transparent honesty, and his steady leadership often challenged those of misguided minds and unethical practices. In his mind there was no question as to right or wrong, truth or error, righteousness or unrighteousness and he lived it before all who knew him.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Charlie and Lula Rigdon chose to name their son after two US presidents. Calvin Coolidge was then the nation’s president, thus the first name, Calvin. Since Calvin was born on February 12, Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, it just seemed right that Lincoln should be his middle name.</p><p>At age seventeen, Calvin Rigdon began his ministry. He preached his first message at a rally in Greenfield, Illinois, in 1943. He took his text from Jeremiah 1:18, where God gave Jeremiah a charge for Israel, and then promised him, “I have made thee this day a defensed city.” Through the years, people across North America heard and remembered sermons such as “Shields of Brass,” “Give Me This Mountain,” “Bound to the Altar,” “An Unusual Choice,” “I Was Born in the House My Father Built,” “You Have Not, Because You Ask Not,” and “Your Altar's Too Small.”</p><p>A general license was issued to Brother Rigdon in 1943 by the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. After participating in the merger of the PCI and the PAJC, he graduated from Apostolic Bible Institute in 1946. He accepted the position of pastor in Grayville, Illinois, in 1947 and served there for two years. In 1949 Calvin Rigdon became the pastor of the church in Carbondale, Illinois, where he served until 1956, leaving behind a brand new church building that had been dedicated just before the time of his departure.</p><p>Calvin Rigdon enjoyed the privilege of occupying several positions of leadership at both the local and national levels. He served as Conquerors president of the Illinois District for five years, from 1946 to 1951, when he was elected to be the international president of the General Youth Division of the United Pentecostal Church. From 1951 to 1956, he continued as pastor of the First Apostolic Church in Carbondale, Illinois, and also served as international youth president. From 1957 to 1960, he served as the first full-time international youth president. It was during his years of service as international youth president (1951-1960), and under his direction, that the Sheaves for Christ program was instituted. This visionary program, begun in 1952, was the first fundraising ministry begun by any department of the UPCI, and it raised a total of $79,348,868 in its first fifty years.</p><p>Following the 1960 General Conference, Calvin Rigdon resigned as general youth president to become the pastor of the First Pentecostal Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He served as presbyter on the Louisiana District Board for ten years, beginning in 1961. He was also editor of the Louisiana Challenger for more than eight years, editing ninety-nine consecutive issues.</p><p>From 1971 until his retirement in 1991, Calvin Rigdon served the organization at the World Evangelism Center, Hazelwood, Missouri, in several executive positions. From 1971 to 1975 he served as the Word Aflame Publications editor. From 1975 to 1976 he filled the office of the director of the General Sunday School Division, at which time he initiated the Bible Reading Enriches Any Day (BREAD) program. From 1976 to 1981, he was editor in chief of UPCI publications. In February 1982 he accepted the office of director of the Historical Center, a position he held until his resignation in January 1991.</p><p>Calvin Rigdon passed from this life on January 10, 1995, at the age of sixty-eight. In passing, Calvin Rigdon left behind his wife of forty-seven years, Virginia; his son, Dan, and wife, Gayla; two daughters, Judith Rigdon and Rebecca and husband Russell Francois; six grandchildren, Holley Rigdon, Heather Rigdon, Danielle Francois, Heidi Rigdon, Andre Francois, and Haylee Rigdon; one sister, Vana, wife of Reverend Oliver Spencer; many other relatives; and a host of friends.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>W. T. Witherspoon came out of the Christian Missionary Church. While attending a church pastored by Willis Stump and Willmina Stump, Charles Mansbridge went to a small mission one night to hear G. T. Haywood preach the message of Jesus' name. Later Charles invited W. T. Witherspoon to hear Haywood. Both men, Witherspoon and Mansbridge, readily received the revelation of Jesus Name baptism.</p><p>In 1916 W. T. Witherspoon was called to the ministry. He opened the church at 32 Brehl Avenue, south of West Broad Street in Columbus. In 1917 the very humble Brehl Avenue church, which seated about one hundred people, was heated by a stove and had gas lights. The congregation had no indoor plumbing. There was no running water but there was one water bucket that served everyone. In the winter when it snowed, sleds provided transportation to church. During one church service, one of the sleds was stolen. Pastor Witherspoon simply searched the neighborhood until he found the sled and returned it to its owner. The lively church services were marked by miracles and growth. Spirited music from a pump organ, piano, tambourine, and triangle inspired praise and worship. Revival was continuous with evangelists such as L. R. Ooton, Andrew Urshan, T. C. Davis, and others. Extended services of two to three weeks were common and often held in tents with sawdust floors. One such meeting was at Broad and Brehl with services every night except Monday. On December 27, 1923, seven young ladies were baptized in the river at Grandview and McKinley Avenues.</p><p>Pastor Witherspoon's next building on Hayden Avenue could seat 250 people, and in 1927 it was remodeled to seat 450 people. By 1935 it was necessary to move to 1074 West Broad Street, which accommodated 700 people. The church was known in those days as the Apostolic Gospel Church. During Witherspoon's ministry, which covered thirty years, he witnessed many conversions to the doctrine of Jesus Name baptism and the Holy Ghost experience with speaking in tongues.</p><p>In 1938 Witherspoon was selected to be general chairman of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. He extended an invitation to the Pentecostal Church Inc. to explore the possibilities of a merger. The Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ and Pentecostal Church Inc. felt they would be able to come together and have fellowship with the goal of unity as a foundation. After lengthy discussions, Witherspoon left the room where the two groups were in session. Pen and paper in hand, he wrote a fundamental doctrine statement for the brethren to consider. The statement was acceptable to everyone. His statement was the final gesture necessary to bring a spirit of unity to both groups.</p><p>The early days of Jesus Name baptism and the Oneness revelation were often troubled with lack of organization. Strong leaders continued seeking common ground where true unity would be a lasting realization. From the 1920s to the 1940s, four of the stronger infant movements, with their elected officers, were led of the Holy Ghost to bring into being an organization that would stand. W. T. Witherspoon served as general chairman with S. R. Hanby, who served as the general secretary-treasurer of three of the groups. The Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, the Pentecostal Ministerial Alliance, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ were nurtured by Witherspoon's strong leadership.</p><p>The other group seeking to unite was the Pentecostal Church Incorporated, with Howard Goss as general chairman and Oscar Vouga as general secretary-treasurer. These two groups met in their general conferences in St. Louis, Missouri, in September 1945 where the merger was completed. The outgrowth of the unity of these two groups was the United Pentecostal Church Incorporated.</p><p>Officers for the newly formed United Pentecostal Church Incorporated were Howard Goss, General Superintendent; W. T. Witherspoon, Assistant General Superintendent; Stanley W. Chambers, General Secretary-Treasurer; and T. R. Dungan, Assistant General Secretary. W. T. Witherspoon was elected to an honorable position in the newly merged United Pentecostal Church International in 1945. His service to the organization ended with his death in 1947.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Carrie Lee Powledge was born near Macon, Georgia, on November 16, 1893. She married Earl Woollsey Eastridge on July 25, 1915, and they had seven children: Nona, Earl, Joel, Johnny, David, Paul, and Jerry. Due to her medical condition, the doctors recommended the climate in the West, so the family moved to Canadian, Texas, where doctors gave Carrie six months to live. But Leila Brown invited Carrie to a home prayer meeting held by Sally McPherson. The group prayed for her, and her pain disappeared. In February 1925 Carrie was baptized in the titles, and she received the Spirit in May of that year. When Walter Lyon came to town the following month preaching baptism in Jesus’ name, Carrie was rebaptized.</p><p>Carrie began her ministry in Norphlet, Arkansas, in 1935. She built churches in Portales, New Mexico, Raymondville, Texas, and Blackwell, Oklahoma, and evangelized in other cities. She moved to Clovis, New Mexico, and started a church in a barber shop. One day the Lord instructed Carrie to stop at a particular house in Clovis. There was a badly burned baby in the home, and God instantly healed him when Carrie prayed. The Methodists were selling a building, and Carrie offered them five hundred dollars. They initially rejected her offer, but when one of the deacons told the Board the story of how Carrie had stopped to pray for his burned son, they accepted the offer. Next Carrie went to Rock Springs, Wyoming, and started a church through home Bible studies.</p><p>The Missions Board approved Carrie for appointment to Africa, but because they would not allow her to take her three youngest sons, ages fourteen, twelve, and ten, she decided not to go. Instead, the Lord showed her the need among the Navajo people in Arizona and Western New Mexico. She moved to Gallup in July 1947 and started a Native American work in nearby Indian Village (now Church Rock). With Home Missions (now North American Missions) support, she soon started a second church in Newcomb.</p><p>In 1956 after the Missions Board turned down her application to Africa because she was sixty-two, she sold her car, bought a ticket, and went to assist her son-in-law and daughter, E. L.and Nona Freeman, in Durban, South Africa. Needing to live at a higher altitude for health reasons, Carrie moved to Umtata, South Africa (now Mthatha), in 1961. After a remarkable service in one lady’s home, twenty-three people were baptized in the Umtata River. At Brother Freeman’s request, Carrie raised necessary funds, bought land, and constructed a church building in that city. Carrie’s poor health required her to return to the US in 1964, after eight and a half years in Africa.</p><p>In 1965 Sister Carrie began traveling among the Navajo people, preaching, teaching Bible studies, and praying for the sick. Often accompanied by her grandson, Martin Eastridge (current Pastor of the Tohatchi church), she would knock on hogan doors as God directed, telling people she had been sent to pray for them. By 1969 a mission site lease was granted by the Navajo Nation. In 1970 the Texico District Home Missions Department built a church building in Tohatchi, New Mexico, and Carrie’s son, Jerry, took over the work. As she had long hoped to do, Carrie returned to Africa just after her seventy-eighth birthday to complete her ten years of African mission work.</p><p>Carrie returned to the Navajo reservation just before turning eighty, leaving a legacy in Africa which includes two church buildings, one of which houses a Bible school, and countless souls born into the kingdom of God. In her later years, Carrie rejoiced to see the Laguna Pueblo being reached at Paguate, New Mexico, and a boy she had reached become pastor of the Durban church.

        "biography": "<p>Timothy A. Dugas was born in Downey, California, on March 22, 1949, to Paul and Donna Dugas. His paternal grandmother (late in her life) married Andrew D. Urshan. Timothy’s father moved to Stockton, California, where he attended and then taught at Western Apostolic Bible College (WABC; now Christian Life College). As a result, Tim grew up around the college and church. Clyde Haney modeled hard work for Tim, and Kenneth Haney showed him how to cast vision.</p><p>Tim began his college education at WABC but just before his senior year, he transferred to a brand-new college in St. Louis, Gateway College of Evangelism. While there, he met Mary Bridger and the summer after graduation from Gateway, in 1970, they married and began a life together in ministry. Next, Tim was invited to assist W. C. Parkey in Kansas City, Missouri. His years there shaped much of his thinking about pastoring, and W. C. Parkey remained his lifelong mentor. Tim became a sectional youth leader, then youth secretary, then youth president of the Missouri District, and he organized the first March for Missions walkathon for Sheaves for Christ. He was invited to move to St Louis, Missouri, to promote the March across North America. Over the past forty-five years, this fundraiser has raised millions. In 1974 he joined the General Youth Division as director of promotions and publications.</p><p>In 1977 after their first child, Matthew, was born, the Dugas family moved to Walla Walla, Washington, to pastor. Tim returned to Stockton, California, in 1979 to become business manager and faculty member of Christian Life Church. In 1981 he became general secretary of the General Home Missions Division (now North American Missions).</p><p>In 1985 Florissant Valley Apostolic Church in Florissant, Missouri elected him as pastor. Pastor Dugas also became president of Gateway College of Evangelism. His leadership helped the college turn the corner after a decade of difficult times. He was the catalyst behind the formation of Urshan Graduate School of Theology, and during his presidency the college began its journey toward accreditation.</p><p>In 1995 the Dugas family added Christina (12) and Christopher (10) to make their family complete.</p><p>He also served as a Missouri district presbyter and as executive presbyter of the UPCI’s north central region. Brother Dugas is a natural teacher and mentor. While pastoring he spearheaded The Jonathan Project, a mentoring ministry for young pastors and ministers which affected more than 140 ministry families over eleven years.</p><p>In 2003, he invited Scott Graham to become co-pastor of Florissant Valley Apostolic Church and they shared the senior leadership role for fifteen years. When the church relocated to Hazelwood, Missouri, Brother Dugas, as is typical of him, thought outside the box and led the church in purchasing a commercial building and retrofitting it as The Sanctuary. He served as general contractor, completing the $5.5 million renovation on time and within budget.</p><p>After the first service in the new church in January 2007, Mary, his wife of thirty-seven years, was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost her battle eleven months later. In 2009 Deanna Sullivan became his second wife. She had come to the Lord under Pastor Dugas’s leadership in 1994, and lost her first husband to cancer in 2006. She has become a great asset to the pastoral team at The Sanctuary. Their families have blended together adding Deanna’s three children, Rachael, Michael, and Daniel. Together they have six children and eight grandchildren.</p><p>Dates and ministry positions cannot adequately capture the essence of a person. It is his character, compassion, and deep spirituality that made Pastor Dugas not only a successful pastor, but also a great Christian. His great leadership has impacted the UPCI on multiple levels. Timothy A. Dugas passed from this life on September 3, 2018.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Nicholas Bibbs Jr. was born on September 1, 1900, in Carrollton, Kentucky. He was the second of eight children born to Nicholas and Lucy Bibbs. The Bibbs family soon moved to Indiana and later to West Virginia.</p><p>Although his family was not religious, young Nick Bibbs had a deep hunger for God. Since his father was very opposed to his going to church, his mother would help him sneak out through a window in his bedroom so he could attend. When he was eighteen years old, he visited a Oneness Pentecostal church that was meeting in a small schoolhouse in St. Albans, West Virginia. Being deeply convicted, Nick repented of his sins and was baptized in Jesus’ name by Pastor Chapman. He received the baptism of the Holy Ghost a short time later.</p><p>In the early 1920s, he met his future wife, Bessie Coleman, in Pennsylvania. While visiting a Nazarene congregation, he testified of his recent conversion experience, including being baptized in Jesus’ name and receiving the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues. The Nazarene pastor felt conviction and asked Brother Bibbs to baptize him. As they gathered at the river, Brother Bibbs asked young Bessie Coleman to hold his coat. At first she said, “No,” but when another girl nearby said, “I will,” Bessie changed her mind and grabbed the coat. Later that day Brother Bibbs told his mother, “Today I saw the girl who is going to be my wife.” They were married on September 27, 1922, and from this union came three children: Lucille, George, and Annette.</p><p>In 1929, Nick and Bessie accepted a pastorate in Elwood, Indiana. Only seven people attended their first service, but the Lord began to bless, and their small building was soon filled. Later they moved to a larger facility, an old downtown theater. During an extended revival at that location 135 were baptized in Jesus’ name and over 100 received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>After three years the Bibbses left Elwood to plant a church in Marion, Indiana. On October 30, 1932, they started a tent revival that lasted eighteen weeks. Brother Bibbs preached the last sixteen weeks himself—with no rest nights. In this meeting, 169 were baptized in Jesus’ name and 147 received the Holy Ghost. In 1948 Brother Bibbs left Marion, having pastored there for over sixteen years.</p><p>Brother Bibbs then pastored in New Castle, Indiana, for approximately three years, and the church experienced significant growth under his leadership.</p><p>Brother Bibbs was well known for being able to take great offerings, for breaking Sunday school attendance records, and for holding meetings where many were filled with the Holy Ghost. He also was instrumental in the 1962 purchase of the sixty-five-acre farm near Fortville, Indiana, where the Indiana District Campgrounds would be established. The first camp meeting on the new grounds was held in 1966.</p><p>Brother Bibbs was first elected district superintendent of Indiana in 1937, before the merger, while he was still with the Pentecostal Church Incorporated. He continued to serve in that office for over thirty years, retiring in 1970. He then served as an honorary member of both the Indiana District Board and the General Board until he went to his heavenly home on May 28, 1985. Bessie Bibbs passed away on August 28, 1998. Brother and Sister Bibbs left us with a legacy well worth remembering!</p>",

        "biography": "<p>On Christmas Eve of 1905, Campbell Boyd Dudley was born to Seth and Catherine Dudley. His mother faithfully read the Bible and taught the family what she knew about Heaven and Hell. Sadly, however, Campbell chose to walk away from her teaching. When winter snow, sometimes six feet deep, made walking to school impossible, he dropped out. By the time he was seventeen he had started drinking and smoking.</p><p>Campbell married Margaret McKenzie on July 26, 1930. He continued to live his sinful life, but one day while he was out in the shed sorting potatoes, a sudden sense of guilt and conviction swept over him. He began to cry out to God for mercy, praying, “Lord Jesus Christ, if You will do something for me, I’ll do something for You.” Moments later, he knew something had happened to him, for now he no longer desired to drink, smoke, or curse. He was a changed man! On October 4, 1936, he was baptized in Jesus’ name and, a few days later, he received the Holy Ghost.</p><p>With his newfound salvation, he dedicated himself to sharing the message of Acts 2:38 with everyone who lived along the Miramichi River. He was known for his anointed preaching, and he saw thousands baptized in Jesus’ name. Even during the cold Canadian winter, he would cut a hole through several feet of ice on the river to baptize people. Although many people mocked, no one caught pneumonia. He also spent many nights praying with people until they received the Holy Ghost. Many will remember hearing his early morning call to prayer throughout the old Harvey Campground. While ringing an old cow bell, he would shout, “Talk all night; sleep all day! Why don’t you get up and pray?”</p><p>C. B. Dudley served as pastor in Gray Rapids for many years while simultaneously pastoring a church in Upper Blackville, New Brunswick. He also opened the church in Chatham (now known as Miramichi), and later pastored in McNamee. He was privileged to preach in many churches, camp meetings, and conferences throughout Canada and the United States, as well as in Colombia, South America.</p><p>Unfortunately, while on an evangelistic endeavour to Newfoundland, he was involved in a serious car accident. He was eventually taken home to McNamee where his wife, Margaret, who was a nurse, could care for him. Sadly, about a month later, Margaret passed away. This was a difficult time for Campbell, but he regained his strength and was soon back in ministry.</p><p>On January 13, 1973, he married Margaret O’Donnell, and they served at the United Pentecostal Bible Institute (now known as Northeast Christian College) for two years. They then went to Gray Rapids to pastor. He finally retired back to McNamee near his beloved Miramichi River, where they enjoyed their final years together. With his life’s work for the Master now completed, C. B. Dudley was promoted to glory on October 7, 1996.</p>",

He began preaching the following January, and from 1957 through 1960 he evangelized in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. He married Roffie Oliver on April 12, 1960, and she traveled with him for the rest of that year. They would eventually have one son, Randy, and a daughter, Deborah.</p><p>In 1961 they planted a new church in Greensboro, North Carolina, and it grew to around 125 by 1963. The next year they bought land and built a beautiful new brick church with seating for 250, classrooms, and living quarters. By 1964 the church was self-supporting, and Jerry resigned as pastor in December.</p><p>In 1965 he began working with the Home Missions Division (now North American Missions) on a part-time basis as the coordinator of the evangelism commission. In 1967 he was appointed as secretary of the general Home Missions Division (now North American Missions). In that role he helped C. H. Yadon and J. T. Pugh inaugurate Christmas for Christ and several other programs. He also founded and edited the magazines Outreach, The Insider, and Forward.</p><p>He also organized the Public Relations Department in 1972 and served as public relations director of the UPCI, coordinating media relations at General Conferences and communicating with politicians in Washington. He wrote and published The Story of the UPCI, which pastors presented to prominent leaders of their communities.</p><p>In 1974 he assumed the pastorate of Apostolic Tabernacle in Texarkana, Arkansas. Beginning in 1976 he served for two years as vice president of Texas Bible College (TBC) under the presidencies of E. L. Holley and C. E. Lott. In 1978 he accepted the pastorate of Life Tabernacle in Wichita Falls, Texas. While he was there, the congregation purchased property and built a new church facility.</p><p>In 1982 he was called back to TBC where he served as president for fourteen years. While there, he launched a fourth-year program called The Center for Advanced Pastoral Studies (CAPS), established an annual Pastor’s Institute, began the ExCeLL (Extension Centers for Learning on Location) program, and wrote a number of new college courses. He was able to help TBC purchase and pay for property to build a new campus near Houston. One building was constructed on that site before the college was moved to Lufkin. He retired from the college in 1996 and moved to Willis, Texas, to assist his son who was founding a church in Conroe, Texas. For the next ten years, he continued to direct and expand the ExCeLL extension program for TBC.</p><p>J. R. Ensey founded and served as president of the Institute of Soteric Counseling, which promoted Christian counseling from Scripture and conducted annual counseling conferences for ten years. He also founded and presided over the Apostolic Theological Forum, which met annually for the presentation of papers by scholars on topics related to our Apostolic identity. He has authored many books, including two on the history of the Bible, and he founded Advance Ministries in 1997 as a publishing arm for his writings. For several years, he published The Apostolic Christian’s Library Builder and Inspirational Journal—a full color thirty-two-page magazine.</p><p>J. R. Ensey has served on many committees and boards within the UPCI. He also has ministered extensively outside North America, including in countries such as Argentina, Italy, and Ethiopia. Participating in an archaeological dig on Mount Ebal in Israel, at the site of Joshua's altar, is a personal highlight. He earned his ThB at Texas Bible College and has been awarded two other non-traditional degrees.</p><p>He is still active in teaching the Full Life Bible Class at Living Way Church in Conroe, Texas, and ministering in various venues. In 2020, he and Roffie will celebrate sixty years of marriage.</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Telie Dover Greer was born in the Ozark Mountain village of Zion, Arkansas, on July 7, 1916. Her birth name was Roxie Artelie Dover, but the name Roxie was only known by her relatives. Telie rhymes with freely, and Telie lived freely and gave her life freely for the work of the Lord.</p><p>When Telie was a baby, an elderly man named Titus knocked on the door of the Dover house and asked to pray for the baby. Titus prayed and proclaimed that the baby girl would preach the gospel all over the world. This prophecy was unbelievable to the family, yet twenty years later Telie was an international evangelist. Her ministry took her to all fifty US states and every province of Canada. She visited over fifty countries, and many miracles and healings occurred in her meetings.</p><p>When Telie was nine, she had a vision of India. In her vision, thousands of Indians were falling off a mountainside, and Telie was the only one who could save them. She knew God had called her to be a missionary to India. In 1933, Ben Green preached a one-month revival in a small Oklahoma town. Only one person received the baptism of the Holy Spirit: the seventeen-year-old Telie Dover. He later said the revival had cost him $100, but that the conversion of Sis Telie was worth every penny.</p><p>Telie tried to go to India in 1936, but due to complications with her visa she was not able to leave. She accompanied Mother McCarty to the New York harbor and told the veteran missionary that they would soon be together in India. However, Telie did not make it to McCarty’s mission until 1947. By that time, McCarty had passed away.</p><p>William Turner wrote that Telie was \"conspicuously bold, bluntly outspoken, beautiful but happily un-genteel as the occasion required … Telie was willing to go anywhere, under any conditions, in order to preach the gospel. She waded through muddy streams, hiked for miles on jungle trails of the Himalayan foothills, [and] survived the bite of a deadly poisonous viper” (from India to the World: The Missionary Pilgrimage of Harry E. Scism).</p><p>There was a group of Presbyterian Revivalists who had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and separated from the Presbyterian church. They had received several prophecies and interpretations of tongues saying, “I will send you an American woman who will teach you.” Somehow they heard of Mother McCarty and wrote to her. McCarty was dead, but Telie Dover received the letter and traveled one thousand miles to the Lushai Hills of Assam in northeast India. She baptized their leader, Zakamnova, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He baptized eight other men, and they baptized a thousand others. Within one year they had established 100 churches and had a constituency of 10,000 members. She contacted Ellis Scism, the newly arrived UPCI missionary to south India, and arranged for him to visit the northeast Indian church. Today there are over 100,000 Jesus Name Pentecostals in northeast India. Additionally, the first United Pentecostals in Myanmar, Bhutan, and Bangladesh were converts of the UPC of North East India.</p><p>In 1956, when Telie was forty years old, she married Talmadge Greer, and they returned to India. Their first son, Landis, was born in 1957. The baby’s health required them to return to the United States, but Sister Telie continued to pray for her “beloved India.” The couple later served as missionaries in Central America, and Telie continued to travel and minister until she was in her eighties. She passed from this life on June 10, 2002.</p>",

His was a family with Apostolic preachers on both sides of the family tree, numbering more than one hundred, including extended family. When Mark was eight years old, his dad, Victor Jordan, left his church plant on the west side of Indianapolis to pastor Christian Temple in Jackson, Michigan, where his uncle and aunt, Gus and Helen Anderson, had formerly pastored.</p><p>Raised in Jackson, Mark specialized in speech and debate in high school. He was captain of the varsity debate team and won several city and regional speech contests. He went to Texas Bible College in 1967, and earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Toledo in 1983. After attending Texas Bible College, he traveled for a year and a half as a single evangelist; then, in 1970, he married Sandy Kinzie, the only child of Fred and Vera Kinzie. Mark and Sandy evangelized until August 1973, then joined her parents in Toledo, Ohio, as assistant pastor at the First Apostolic Church, following Robert and Diane Stroup in that position.</p><p>Fred Kinzie retired in 1983, and the church elected Mark as senior pastor. He served in that role for thirty years. During his pastorate, the church built a one-thousand-seat sanctuary and a Family Life Center and started five daughter works, two of which merged to form a dynamic, autonomous church in Archbold, Ohio, in 2012. Fourteen ministers entered the field under the ministry of Brother Jordan. In the strong tradition of a missions-minded church, the Jordans traveled and preached extensively in Europe, South America, and Asia, as well as many venues in North America. On the home front, in the 1980s Brother and Sister Jordan adopted three children, Ryan, Ross, and René. All three are now married and attend UPCI churches with their spouses. The Jordans also have four grandchildren and five “grand-dogs.”</p><p>J. Mark Jordan served the Ohio District as sectional youth director, district youth secretary, and district youth president. The Ohio ministers elected him to be district superintendent in 1995, an office he held for twenty-two years. During that time he also served as a member of the Executive Board for five years, the Board of Directors of Urshan Graduate School of Theology and Urshan College for fifteen years, the Board of Publication for twenty-eight years, and as a member of several general ad hoc committees. He now serves as an honorary member of both the Ohio District Board and the General Board.</p><p>In more than fifty years of ministry, Brother Jordan has contributed many articles to various district and general publications, and has written and published twenty books, most of which are handled by Pentecostal Publishing House. He recently finished his autobiography. He retired in 2013, turning the pastorate over to Kris and Jenn Dillingham. The church named Brother Jordan as bishop of the First Apostolic Church, and he and Sandy still live in the area and remain members. He continues to write and travel at home and overseas, preaching and teaching leadership, family seminars, and ministers’ retreats.</p>",
